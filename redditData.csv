"""Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer""",1730297809.0,210,1gfnkti,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfnkti/super_micro_computer_inc_nasdaqsmci_is_an/,118,"From an article yesterday on Yahoo Finance courtesy of Insider Monkey, the day before Ernst & Young resigns as their accountant and the stock drops by 1/3. The stock market lottery has a surprise around every corner. Long, short, whatever you want, there's a chance. If this convinced you to get back in yesterday, what a surprise was in store today.  


Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage.

At the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers.

Though not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro’s revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market’s explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers.

The confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built.

The soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds.

NerdWallet stock is going to fall when they report in a few hours. Don't say I didn't tell you.,1730226402.0,2001,1gf1o2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gf1o2t/nerdwallet_stock_is_going_to_fall_when_they/,836,"I know this is a newish account, but I can't have you seeing my salacious Reddit history from my real account. However, I have a very particular stock strategy that when I do see the stars align it works out well.  So if you are sick of losing and want a nice win that should net at least 40% gains then this is the one for you.

Nerdwallet is a website that relies on all monetization through their website. In their most recent 10-K (you don't need to worry about it its finance stuff) they said that **""In 2023, over 70% of all traffic to NerdWallet came organically through direct or unpaid channels.""** they then go on to say ""**we are dependent on internet search engines particularly Google... if our search results page rankings decline for other reasons, traffic to our platform or user growth or engagement could decline, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.""**

I think it's pretty clear they need Google visits for the business to survive. If you really care, you can go back through other previous earnings calls and see they mention traffic nearly every time.

So why does this matter and how do you make money? Every few months Google releases an update to their algorithm that determines how a website should show up. I know this is a massive oversimplification, so when you Google ""whats the best credit card for people with bad credit"" these companies make money when you go to their website and click through to a partner credit card offer.

But what happens when Google says NerdWallet you aren't as good as we thought you were and moves you down in rankings? For those not smart enough, if clicks go down money goes down. 

**So here are there expectations, to be better then Q3 of last year.**

https://preview.redd.it/odyjnvxrlqxd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=577c772611e98c61c4033982f222e102962cdf76

**But what actually happened to NerdWallet website visits over the last 12 months?**

As you can see in Q1 of last year NerdWallet was at a high point. This lead into a increased expectation of the value in Q3/Q4 last year. However, note in Q2 and Q3 they got hit by Google and lost a significant amount of web visits.

https://preview.redd.it/go437jjylqxd1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=f815abc08eec2d9c94a1c3ecf89a98d4e29c3ec5

**What's a real World example of this?**

If you Googled ""home equity loan rates"" last year, NerdWallet would show up on the first page of the results. Now, if you Google the same thing, they aren't there. 

**For those of you who like numbers, what does this actually mean when comparing quarter over quarter and even year over year?**

https://preview.redd.it/1c78sdxemqxd1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=224a23e405ae9657bac99a3f7701a3307c3e48ed

Because the market is closing soon I am not even going to get into all the headwinds and losses they will also take as a result of Google AI overviews. This is only going to threaten their business over the next 18 months.

I come to you today asking for not only your thoughts and your advice, but also for your honesty. I want you regards to think about this for more than half a second before you say the first thing that comes to your degenerate minds.

Before you read this, keep in mind Robinhood stock $HOOD has been on a run, up 70% in the past 3 months. 

I am a regarded Robinhood user myself. I signed up for Robinhood Gold in July of this year for all of the attractive perks (no, not those attractive perks Diddy) that they offer:

• 4.5% interest on uninvested cash (was 5% until the FED cut rates)
• 3.0% IRA Contribution match
• 1.0% Deposit match
• $1k of interest-free margin
• Level 2 Market Data

In addition to these perks, Robinhood has launched a new advanced desktop trading platform (Robinhood Legend) and also offers a new credit card exclusively for Gold members that earns 3% cash back on all purchases, which is pretty rare. I think it is bullish that they are offering an unprecedented amount of cash back on all purchases - they must be doing pretty well to be able to offer this, right? And the only way to gain access to this credit card is through signing up for Robinhood gold.

I think Robinhood’s platform is likely the preferred choice for the younger investor due to its easy to use and intuitive interface. It’s like the iPhone of stock trading apps. But, with these new offerings from Robinhood, including their new advanced trading platform, I could see it appealing to more and more older investors and retaining a higher percentage of their users as they get older, while continuing to be the preferred choice for the younger investor.

Robinhood got me to sign up for Gold this summer. I am enjoying the perks and am confident I am making more money with these perks than what I am paying to have access to these perks ($5 per month). I think Robinhood’s platform is the most user friendly and easy to use. 

That is why I am long $HOOD. Although the stock is on a 70% run over the past 3 months, I believe the stock will moon after their Q3 earnings report is released. Who is with me? Who is against me? Anybody buying Puts? Let me hear your honest thoughts on the stock you regards.

Jk, let’s all just buy FD’s

PLTR $250M+ of Insider Selling???,1730319041.0,13,1gfw0r4,https://open.substack.com/pub/andrew310743/p/flying-too-close-to-the-sun?utm_source=app-post-stats-page&r=1rwlhn&utm_medium=iosj,33,"Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: 
Recommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch.
Company Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are:
Gotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates.
The advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs)
To give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin).
Most recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising
Investment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. 
First let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players:
NVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales.
So–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no.
Proponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects.
Next, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well)
On the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters.
Furthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. 
Finally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams).
The realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk.
Valuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels.
Risk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings.
Unexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025.
To hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.

I Called RDDT Here - What I'm Betting on Next,1730329515.0,6,1gg01hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gg01hh/i_called_rddt_here_what_im_betting_on_next/,16,"[I made a crappy DD on RDDT](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gc6c84/rddt_dd_youre_here_arent_you/), but as long as you don't listen to the doubters, if you trust your instinct this earnings season, you seem to be rewarded

Let's go from least spicy to most spicy

**Spicy lvl#1:** $HOOD just reported and flopped. But it's time to buy the dip. All you regards hated on RDDT IPO, but still use it 24/7... Now robinhood is the long term winner, all you regards STILL use it after everything we've been through. But for options, this will have to wait until next time for calls, so shares on the dip for now...

**Spicy lvl#2:** $DJT puts. This is pretty simple, if Kamala wins the election, DJT should drop to sub $20 levels because Trump won't have any power and the company is useless. And even if Trump wins, as the president there's a chance he would have to sell his shares and the stock could still drop pre $20.

**Spicy lvl#3:** $ABNB reports next week Thursday. The stock is ready for a rebound. Now, Airbnb is a money printer, everyone knows what it is, and the whole world relies on it pretty much at this point. Now what's different this time? This the quarter where they always make a big blowout. [you can see here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABNB/analysis/) they are usually estimated at less than a dollar earnings per share, but the estimate this quarter is a +$2.14. Last year they reported an EPS of $6.63 this quarter. It's vacation season THEN christmas season; we are inbound for an earnings CRUSH and RAISE GUIDANCE.

**Spicy lvl#4:** $DUOL reports next week Thursday as well. This is that language learning app everyone trashes on... BUT THEY ALL USE! Similar to Reddit with its IPO, and similar with Hood. People love to trash talk, but then still use that ""trash"". Duolingo has been spreading like wildfire. Yes it's true the stock has run up a ton, but for good reason. The platform is growing like crazy, and the app is almost unusable without paying for it. It has basically become a netflix for people who don't want to be braindead. And they're implementing new AI features and levels of paying. If you haven't heard people talk about this app, then you're lying or live under a rock. There is no reason this will not keep crushing and guiding up.

Intel isn’t just struggling with sales and aging tech—it’s dealing with a leadership crisis that might finally reach a breaking point.

[MSOS/TLRY/CGC] The DEA begins calling witnesses for cannabis rescheduling ALJ hearing: Stakeholders and prohibitionists are invited so far.,1730285797.0,38,1gfjqx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfjqx5/msostlrycgc_the_dea_begins_calling_witnesses_for/,4,"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/dea-begins-selecting-witnesses-for-marijuana-rescheduling-hearing-inviting-industry-stakeholders-and-prohibitionists-to-testify/

""The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has started selecting witnesses to participate in a much-anticipated hearing on the Biden administration’s proposal to federally reschedule marijuana that’s scheduled for December, Marijuana Moment has learned.""

""This comes about seven months after the Justice Department formally proposed moving cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) following a scientific review. After a public comment period, which saw tens of thousands of people weigh in on the issue, a hearing was set for December 2 to gather additional expert input.""

**""The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) is among those that received a notice from DEA this week that their request to participate in the hearing has been granted.""**

**""A source familiar with the administrative proceedings told Marijuana Moment that anti-cannabis groups Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) and National Drug & Alcohol Screening Association (NDASA) have also received notices granting their requests.""**

""It’s not clear how many witnesses DEA selected of the many who submitted requests ahead of the hearing, nor it is apparent whether the agency plans to continue granting requests on a rolling basis in the coming weeks. Representatives of major pro-marijuana organizations such as NORML and the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) said they have not yet received a response on their requests to participate as of Tuesday afternoon.""

So the presence of two major anti-marijuana groups were already expected, the DEA will have to hear both sides of the aisle in the matter, but it feels odd that they invited anti-marijuana groups but so far, did not invited any pro-marijuana group besides major stakeholders in the industry.

Regardless, out of all the comments that were sent to the DEA a month ago, the amount of positive comments to rescheduling the plant completely dwarfed the negatives, and the invitation process is just beginning anyway, so I can assume that more people and groups will be invited.

Either way, I do not expect this rescheduling process to be over this year, given that the ALJ will only happen in December, even if it, it would only be  in efeect in 2025 anyway.

Positions: 1000 shares of MSOS @ $7.69 average.

I'm holding through the elections, so far the polls are looking favorable for Florida's Amendment 3 passing which will be great for the tier 1 MSOs, but I'm also keeping an eye out on who is going to be elected in November, and what the cabinet is gonna look like.

The sector went up last week, but now it's further down than before, if you're on this ride then expect lots of volatility and market dumps in the coming days. Weedstocks are not for the faint of heart.

Reddit's Q3 earnings release just dropped. Revenue surged 68% year-over-year.

Nvidia's GPUs can be used as AI accelerators because of their CUDA API. It is a proprietary parallel computing API for general purpose computing. Only their GPUs can be used with CUDA. If you want to use GPUs to accelerate AI training, you have to use CUDA. NVDA has a monopoly on AI accelerators because of CUDA. AMD GPUs cannot be used with CUDA.

  
Google has TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). They are processing chips specifically meant for AI training. They have been working on it for 10 years now. Yes, Google is entering the semiconductor space. Google has their own parallel computing framework built into TensorFlow to utilise their TPUs. Google is not reliant on Nivida for AI accelerators like other companies because of their TPUs.

TPUs run much faster and consume less power than GPUs. GPUs however are better for precision calculations. Lower precision calculations is what makes TPUs much faster than GPUs to get an AI model most of the way in training.

Google does not sell their TPUs. They have a monopoly on it. They only rent their TPUs via Google Cloud. The TPU is why Google Cloud is doing well. Companies that want to use TPUs will have to use Google Cloud. This will erode AWS and Azure market share.

If you have expectations that AMD will be able to capture some of the AI hardware hype, you're mistaken about the technology."

With some quick research I saw ppl generally have a good sentiment about Amazon medical care telehealth and how they were seen by a professional within 10 mins. I gave it a try and behold, within 10 minutes I was talking to a doctor, and 20 mins confirmed diagnosis. 

I take this as a sign to jump in Amazon now. The e-commerce platform has a lock on almost everyone you know, we all use it every week. AWS is massive and continues to grow. Whole foods is my number 1 go to grocery store. And slowly but surely medical care thru Amazon will become more popularized Amazon is continually diversifying its revenue and business streams, and doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to falling out of relevance.

Can GOOGL rise,1730301122.0,3,1gfovjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfovjw/can_googl_rise/,3,"GOOGL because of the earnings report soared 6%, GOOGL's earnings report for more than a year of AI hype, is to eat a shot in the arm, because AI can finally bring revenue growth.GOOGL's revenue growth of 15%, exceeding the market's expectations of 12%. the application of AI technology to the cloud business is more than the promotion of Wall Street's expectations to help the Google cloud revenue to more rapid growth, the growth rate of more than 30 per cent.

Over the past year or so, GOOGL has demonstrated a variety of search products powered by generative AI technology that have opened up the user's search experience to more imaginative possibilities, and today AI overviews (AI overviews) are approaching 20 billion search requests per month, while GOOGL's margins have grown to 32% on the back of AI, a true staging of the what it means for an elephant to dance.

AI this round of technological change, the giant is certainly the first to benefit, because the giant scale itself is large, there will inevitably be a variety of big business disease, the efficiency is certainly declining, and now AI comes, slightly improve the efficiency, the effect will be quite obvious.

The reason why GOOGL's margins and revenue beat expectations this time around is actually what we predicted a few days ago, that AI has allowed the cost of ad production to slide, which has boosted advertisers' willingness to place ads dramatically, especially on the youtube side of the equation, which is dramatically outperforming the market's expectations this quarter."

> The planemaker sold 112.5 million common shares for $143 each, according to a statement. The stock was priced at a discount of about 7.7% to its Friday closing price of $155.01 each. 

> The company also sold $5 billion of depositary shares that represent a 1/20th stake in mandatory convertible preferred shares, the statement said. 

> The infusion of funds clears one of new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg’s most urgent tasks. Boeing’s balance sheet was strained by years of turmoil and the fallout from a strike, now in its seventh week, that is crippling manufacturing of the company’s main cash cow, the 737 Max jetliner. Boeing needed the capital infusion to maintain its investment-grade rating and fund its production ramp-up once the walkout ends.

> The company is on pace to use around $4 billion in cash during the fourth quarter, which would bring its free-cash outflow to around $14 billion for the year. The planemaker expects to continue burning cash through the first half of next year as it restarts its factories, including the 737 Max assembly lines.

Valeo: The Europoor EV Play You're Too Rich to Notice,1730298597.0,1,1gfnvmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfnvmk/valeo_the_europoor_ev_play_youre_too_rich_to/,8,"Read up, I know this is **WallStreet** Bets but while you've been busy losing money on $TSLA calls, there's an actual value play in the europoor EV space that's criminally undervalued: Valeo, the French auto supplier that's about to make your wife's boyfriend jealous.

**TL;DR:**

* Massively undervalued based on fundamentals
* Rising profit margins in coming quarters
* Confirmed strong cash flow
* Already announced debt reduction plan
* Huge R&D investments already made
* Cost reduction strategy in progress
* Short-term 🌈🐻 manipulating price down based on slight revenue dip and debt.

**🚀 Short Squeeze Potential**:  
The stock has significant short interest with bears piling in on revenue guidance. But these 🌈🐻 are about to get caught with their pants down when:

* Margin improvements hit next quarter
* EV transition accelerates
* Cost reduction results start showing
* Debt reduction plan delivers

**Why Your Smooth Brain Should Care:**

1. They're balls deep in EV AND Self-Driving tech when every boomer car manufacturer is trying to catch up to Tesla
2. Stock is getting hammered short term but bottom has been resisting for a while now = perfect entry for patient autists
3. Increasing dividends coming for those who can hold without paper handing

**The Real DD:**  
Short sellers are having a field day with the revenue guidance being slightly down for next year. But here's what these 🤡 are missing - Valeo is positioning for the entire auto industry's transition to EV and to add self driving feature. They've already done the hard part with R&D investment while implementing cost-cutting measures. They have a world class AI division (valeo.ai) and provide the best Lidar around.

**Price Action:**  
The stock is getting beaten down harder than your portfolio after a JPow speech. But unlike your options plays, this has actual fundamentals behind it. When the EV transition accelerates, those who diamond handed this will be laughing.

**Position or Ban:**  
Currently holding shares because I actually believe in this play (and I'm too europoor for options).

Remember: This is not financial advice. My strategy is usually to buy high sell low."

1. **Production Challenges**: Lucid has faced significant delays in ramping up production of its electric vehicles (EVs), which raises concerns about its ability to meet demand and achieve profitability.

2. **High Valuation**: The stock has often been seen as overvalued compared to its revenue and production numbers, leading some investors to view it as a speculative investment rather than a sound long-term pick.

3. **Competition**: The EV market is rapidly growing, with established automakers and new entrants competing fiercely. Lucid faces stiff competition from companies like Tesla, Rivian, and traditional automakers that are expanding their EV offerings.

4. **Financial Stability**: Concerns about cash flow and the company's ability to finance its operations and growth plans can deter investors. If the company struggles to sell vehicles or generate revenue, that could negatively impact its stock performance.

5. **Market Sentiment**: Stock performance can be influenced by broader market trends. If investor sentiment towards EVs or growth stocks shifts, Lucid's stock could be adversely affected.

6. **Management Decisions**: Any perceived mismanagement or lack of strategic vision can lead to a loss of investor confidence. 

Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

MSFT Pre-Earnings Analysis: AI Arms Race and Channel Check - AI Number May Show Double Digit Growth in Q1 2025 - Monster Quarter Growth,1730253399.0,10,1gfbrmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfbrmf/msft_preearnings_analysis_ai_arms_race_and/,19,"This might be one of Microsoft's most influential quarters in quite some time. The main argument for my thesis is OpenAI and recent AI model upgrades from in the form of GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-o1, and GPT-o1-mini. As well, I don't know if anyone noticed their Uranium portfolio's going through the roof but if not check out SMR, OKLO and others to see more. AI needs so much power that they are opening up defunct nuclear power plants on 3-mile island in Pennsylvania for new energy sources.

What most media types don't have a window into, mostly I assume this because they keep saying the same silly thing over and over again, is that enterprise is using AI. AI is not going to come in the form of a ""killer app"". The killer app is ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Mistral. Those are the killer apps but those are also not important things in the AI arms race. AI in and of in itself is the killer app. The reason for this is that it commoditized intelligence in the form of tokens that can be literally bought and sold through the cloud.

When certain media types keep railing on the notion that ""who's making money with this"" they are missing the reality in that people are making money with this each and every day. The enterprise is creating applications that are simply not understood by everyday people or analysts because there not the ""killer apps"" that people think of which represents mostly something popular that teenagers and young adults are into. Is Venmo a killer app? Is Facebook a killer apps still? I don't know maybe I'm just not with the times. What i do know is that is that AI is so large and so democratized that the use cases, while not killer, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in the enterprise setting.

This is the fast and steady drum beat of GAI increasingly taking over all human cognitive tasks.  It won't happen overnight but it is happening. I think what is happening with the media is that they can't put a metric to it so I will attempt to.

AI adoption and penetration into everyday processes and tasks for enterprise is probably at 0.6%-1%. If you include the backlog of potential AI penetration it is probably 2 - 5% of all enterprise tasks and processes. The immediate 1 - 2 year outlook of AI penetration is probably 1 - 3% with a backlog of 6-9%. To be clear, I am not considering productivity gains because who the hell cares about any of that.  I am specifically speaking about cold hard ROI of implementing an AI automation system and having that AI do the work that was once a human task now offloading to an AI automation task.

I don't know how you feel about the above numbers but in my interpretation it is incredibly slow but growth can be incredibly exponential in relatively a short amount of time. The reason, I've written about this many times before, is because the data is not ready, the talent is not there to reconstruct and rebuild what needs to be in place to make efficient data process that are specific to AI, and many many other factors.

This is why consulting through the likes of Accenture, Palantir, IBM and others will be very important in the coming years. It's my opinion that companies now matter how large or small won't be able to put in the right processes without proven practices that will foster from consultancy groups rather than at home grown talent. However, there will be clues of how well the progress is going. An AI channel check if you will.

**AI Channel Check through Microsoft Azure:**

Microsoft provides this channel check for us. Alphabet just completed their channel check and the news on AI was good. Continued spending for all things AI and healthy numbers in their core businesses to justify the continued spend. I look for Microsoft to report much in the same way in terms of AI CapEx/Spend.

2 quarters ago Microsoft started reporting the AI portion of their Azure Cloud revenues. 2 quarters ago it was 6%, and the previous quarter it rose to 7%. For their earnings report tomorrow the AI revenue should be in the 10-12% range. In my opinion 8% is not going to cut it. 1% quarterly gain seems slow. The number in aggregate should be 2%+ quarter to quarter growth. In this way, 1% isn't going to cut it for Wall Street. Perhaps we do see 8%-9% next quarter and that wouldn't be a horrible thing but if Microsoft wants to blow the doors off of earnings and reestablish a healthy growth pattern it is of my opinion that number of percent AI revenue shares needs a meaningful bps up.

I believe that in this earnings there will be that meaningful click upwards of AI percentage growth for Microsoft in the 10%+ range. 11% would be a bust out surprise and 12% would be significantly positive. So where is this possible 3% rise in AI revenue growth coming from? Look no further than GPT-4o.

**GPT-4o and the AI Number**

Gpt-4o was initially released on May 13, 2024. For reference, Microsoft's last quarter was, Q4 2024, ended on June 30, 2024, with earnings reported on July 30, 2024. **AI number 7%**. There was no way for GPT-4o to significantly penetrate into their earnings with only roughly 30 days of usage. If you take into account the iterations of 4o itself the model initially was met with skepticism (compared to GPT-4-Turbo) and apprehension until subsequent versions of 4o were released. All-in-all, there is no way GPT-4o was going to be in the previous quarters (Q4) earnings report.

However, what's even more interesting is the increase in quota and throughput of GPT-4 to GPT-4o. This is where I believe the AI number from Microsoft will materially increase. Let's take a look.

First, let's start with **GPT-4-Turbo** which was released November 6, 2023.

**Git Commit** [e477326](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/e4773268e4e732aefff0f4e3e448568dd4ed998a/articles/ai-services/openai/concepts/models.md):

Commit **e477326** was dated to Nov 22, 2023. A preview was available, 1106, as of Nov 17, 2023. Using this as a ground truth you can see that the token limit is 134k per minute with a max of 2.7 K requests per minute. this and surely prior to this was hell on enterprises to do any meaningful work with the models. It was great for experimenting and getting started but not for meaningful production work.

**GPT-4o** was released on May 13, 2024.

**Git Commit** [431bb24](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/431bb24aadae464afbeb46a522cf613dc9418025/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

https://preview.redd.it/wyyz8h6sosxd1.png?width=1020&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91756d0d138410a1bbc5e007bccb147828aac74

Commit **431bb24** was dated to May 20, 2024. As you can see from previous GPT-4 capacity limitations GPT-4o introduced a massive improvement for quota limit TPM and requests per minute RPM. This is a significant release for enterprise customers as they can now begin to plan, develop, and execute AI software stacks into production environments. 60 K RPM's is a 22X upgrade towards production throughput.

**Git Commit** [30084ae](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/30084aee1f0f82335490af8b4b7bd8912cc02af0/articles/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits.md):

Commit **30084ae** was dated July 24, 2024. In this update the quota TPM was raised from 10M to 30M tokens per minute.

[**Current Quota Limits**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/quotas-limits):

https://preview.redd.it/l2ah831essxd1.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f59ee5eb421e81d5eb40afb16147f11b3b0c293

In the current quota limits there is a 180 K RPM increase from 60 K. At this point and earlier in the quarter OpenAI's GPT-4o models became capacity unlocked. There is nothing you cannot do or plan for in terms of AI model integrations, TPM's, or RPM throughput. At this moment, intelligence is untethered from any api constraints. What you can imagine building in terms of AI and LLMs and the delivery of those products and services can be fully realized without constraint.

If you go from the beginning analysis of GPT-4-Turbo until today there is a **223X tokens per minute (TPM) increase and a 66.66X request per minute (RPM) increase.**

This is a massive throughput gain that cannot be expressed enough of how significant this is in terms of AI advancements regarding enterprise adoption.

This is why I believe the AI Number finally breaks the double digits in this quarter of 10%+. Ever since the last quarter ended, June 30, 2024, there has been a steady stream of AI model improvements and api throughput improvements that are significant in scope. If you couple this with Google's continued AI spend and quality quarter, AI hardware channel checks that verify the AI hardware spend, and a github repo commit history that shows nothing but blazing improvements for Microsoft Azure intelligence; It could not be more clear to me that Microsoft is executing on all levels and should deliver a potentially monster quarter.

Not that it needs it but here is the plug for NVDA as well. All of those github commits and throughput improvements are directly related to Microsoft bringing data centers online all over the world.

This is insane! I don't have to tell you the git commits for this graph are absolutely bonkers too.

$F Freaky? Future? Ford.,1730254561.0,7,1gfc5dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gfc5dw/f_freaky_future_ford/,36,"Are you kidding me? Overnight dump and the thing only moves down a dollar? A 2-cent BEAT on EPS and a 10th consecutive revenue beat? Like 250 MILLION SHARES in VOLUME over the last TWO days? Please, this thing is primed for takeoff as soon as the covered call bitches are done.

A few key points:

-First off, and most importantly, Ford is becoming a software company. They have over 12000 software engineers. The potential profit from commercial and governmental fleet management is sky high. They already have 630,000 subscribers at an average of $7-8 dollars a month. That's 60 million dollars a year for just software already, and they're only scratching the surface. And what happens when we need a more popular brand than Tesla for LIDAR and optical mapping for all the self-driving cars and robots working in public? What happens when all service vehicles are ALREADY Fords? No other brand will have the tech or reach, or relationship with the US govt. and companies.

-Ford is SELLING their cars, often even with their own financing (by the way Ford Credit is making BANK). Their leases are so low they don't even bother discussing them, and that is key considering their competition will have lots full of old inventory piling up. Look at their Maverick sales. Look at their LINCOLN sales up 50% YoY. The Nautilus is by far the most well received SUV we've seen all year.

-Ford is expanding remote and mobile service; yet another profit/revenue stream.

-Ford's EVs are only getting better. Have yall seen the Mach E Rally? Thing is a beast and looks good too. The 2025 Mach E will have all US parts and should have an under 30k price tag with the government incentive, making it competitive with even chinese EV pricing IN CHINA. Ford is already shipping Tesla supercharger adapters for their chargers, and collaboration with Tesla should only grow deeper as both companies realize they need eachother for the overall future of US excellence and dominance in the automotive industry.

-The ex-dividend date is coming up on November 7th, and I see 0 chance, as in ain't no way, this thing is going lower. Who wouldn't want 15 cents a share on a stock trading under 11 dollars for the last time in history?

-CEO Jim Farley is late comedian star Chris Farley's cousin, so the boomers, Gen X, and millenials all know what the fuck is up.

TL;DR: This is not just a car company, it's a TECH company. I bought more shares and long dated calls today because FUCK WHOEVER IS SELLING. Honestly, I might get even more tomorrow morning and EAT on that dividend AND profits for the next 20 YEARS as it becomes the best selling brand in the US and worldwide. THIS IS AMERICA MOTHERFUCKER! BUILT FORD TOUGH.

UPDATE: I'm not gay but 1% is 1%

UPDATE 2: I don't give a fuck it's going up suck my dick"

Goldman Says Traders Are Too Worried About Delays to US Vote Result,1730239459.0,11,1gf6ux5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gf6ux5/goldman_says_traders_are_too_worried_about_delays/,7,"Source: Bloom-berg news

[Goldman Sachs Group Inc.](https://archive.ph/o/rq4QH/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GS:US) said global investors are overstating the risk that financial markets will be plunged into uncertainty by the lack of a clear victor soon after next week’s US presidential election.“While we recognize the tail risk possibilities, we think market participants appear to be somewhat overestimating the probability that a delayed result will prevent financial markets from reflecting the likely election outcome on election night or early the next morning,” Goldman’s Michael Cahill, Lexi Kanter and Alec Phillips wrote in a note Tuesday.

Underpinning Goldman’s view is a range of factors. For one, tight state-level and national polling is obscuring what is likely to be a wider margin of victory in the electoral college. For another, changes to how states process ballots since the pandemic should speed along vote counting compared with 2020, the strategists said.Looking at the last two elections as a guide, 

Goldman found that most of the volatility in currency markets pops up just as the initial vote tallies begin coming in, during the Tokyo trading session. The announcement of key county-level results, rather than race calls, is a primary driver of exchange rates as early results are reported, the bank noted.“In both 2016 and 2020, the vast majority of FX volatility occurred in the first few hours of the results,” the strategists wrote. “While volatility was still somewhat elevated in London trading hours, things generally returned to ‘normal’ by the NY afternoon the day after the election.”"

Here’s a lighthearted skit playing off the classic “Asian parents” stereotype, imagining AMD CEO Lisa Su getting some “feedback” from her parents about her cousin Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA.

[Scene: Lisa Su visiting her parents for dinner. They’re seated at the dining table, her mom serving food, her dad reading a newspaper.]

Mom: [sighs loudly] Lisa, why so quiet? You seem stressed. Not like your cousin Jensen—he always looks so happy. Maybe it’s because he’s running NVIDIA.

Lisa: Mom, I’m the CEO of AMD. We’re doing really well! Have you seen our new Ryzen processors?

Dad: Ryzen, Ryzen… didn’t Jensen make something called… the Titan? Or what is it, the 4090? That sounds strong. Titan! Like a god.

Lisa: [rolls her eyes] Dad, AMD is doing great! We’re taking on Intel in the CPU market, and our GPUs are competitive, too.

Mom: [cutting her off] Yes, yes, very nice, Lisa. But Jensen… he is always in the news! All the kids want NVIDIA graphics cards. I asked your auntie, she said his sales are “through the roof!”

Dad: [nodding] And didn’t he just announce some AI thing? All the big tech companies want NVIDIA chips! AI, Lisa! When are you going to do AI?

Lisa: [frustrated] We are doing AI! AMD has products in AI, too! And, anyway, not everything is about AI.

Mom: Oh, honey, don’t be so defensive. We’re just saying, maybe try a little harder, you know? Think… bigger. You’re smart—almost as smart as Jensen.

Dad: Exactly! We’re not asking for much. Just maybe… make AMD a little more… “NVIDIA.”

Lisa: [sighs, mumbling to herself] Maybe I should’ve gone into law like a normal person…

Mom: [patting her hand] Oh, Lisa, we’re just proud of you. Not as proud as Jensen’s parents, but very proud.

How I loaned 40k CHF @ 0.6% APR,1730196209.0,109,1geqy9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1geqy9q/how_i_loaned_40k_chf_06_apr/,60,"I just recently learned how to borrow money on margin with a box spread option strategy. However, I only saw discussions about borrowing USD through SPX options. So I wondered if I could do the same with a lower interest currency - CHF. Well, I did it!

I used options on Swiss market index (SMI) expiring Sep 18 2025 (324 DTE) with strikes of 10000 and 14000. The exact strikes don't matter, what matters is the difference between them - 4000 points equaling 40k CHF.

On IBKR the order looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/du0mqkwb1oxd1.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=60c37e45bcff4841110831c550a2e9e874d8292a

I wanted to see the best rate I can get, so I started with the price -4000, and gradually increased it. My order got quickly filled at -3980. That means I got +39,800 CHF in cash, and have to pay back 40,000 CHF at expiration. My total interest is fixed at 200 CHF - 0.5% to expiration or 0.6% annualised. Previously I was paying 2.363% margin interest on CHF to IBKR, so over the year I will save 1.763% or 700 CHF.

Important to keep in mind:

1. This only works with European-style options (cannot be exercised early).
2. Be careful about entering the price. One small mistake, like not adding a minus sign, can result in a huge loss."

TSLA will face new challenges ,1730227491.0,12,1gf23wl,https://i.redd.it/tjzpyofnqqxd1.jpeg,14,"Tesla, once a disruptor in the electric car industry, is now facing enormous pressure from the market and competitors. Despite a strong third-quarter earnings report, with revenue up 8% and net income up 17%, Wall Street has questioned its position among the “seven giants of the U.S. stock market”.
High valuation, over-reliance on the core automotive business, as well as the lagging effect of investment in artificial intelligence and robotics, have become the hidden concerns of Tesla's future development

Tesla has revolutionized the electric car industry, promoted sustainable energy, and attracted a large number of loyal fans with its unique brand appeal. However, under the halo there is also a hidden crisis
First, Tesla's valuation is too high. Its forward-looking price-earnings ratio is close to 73 times, much higher than other “Seven Giants” companies. The high valuation means that the market has high hopes for Tesla's future profitability, but it also increases the risk of volatility in its stock price. If future results fall short of expectations, the stock price may face a sharp pullback.
Second, Tesla is overly dependent on its core automotive business. Compared with other tech giants, Tesla's business structure is relatively homogeneous, with its main source of revenue still being car sales. This dependence makes Tesla more vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in the auto market
Finally, Tesla's investments in artificial intelligence and robotics have yet to translate into actual profitability. Although Elon has always emphasized Tesla's technological attributes, the long payback cycle of investments in these fields makes it difficult to have a significant impact on the company's performance in the short term

Tesla's success has also attracted many competitors. Traditional automakers are launching electric models and new electric vehicle companies are emerging. In a highly competitive market, Tesla needs to keep innovating to stay ahead of the game.
In addition to competition from the auto industry, Tesla also needs to face challenges from tech giants. Companies such as Apple and Google are actively laying out self-driving technology and may launch their own electric car products in the future.
These tech giants have strong financial strength and technology accumulation, posing a potential threat to Tesla
Despite the many challenges it faces, Tesla is still a company full of potential. Its leadership in the electric vehicle sector, Musk's leadership and continued investment in technology innovation all give it the potential for long-term growth.
For investors, there is a need to remain cautiously optimistic about investing in Tesla. On the one hand, Tesla's growth potential is huge, and its layouts in artificial intelligence and robotics could bring lucrative returns in the future. On the other hand, Tesla's high valuation and intensified market competition also increase investment risks."

The Real Reason META Will Be the Most Valuable Company in the World,1730232959.0,5,1gf4b87,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gf4b87/the_real_reason_meta_will_be_the_most_valuable/,14,"TLDR: Zuck is building an AI-powered money printer that makes JPow look amateur. They're about to turn every pixel, photo, and IRL surface into perfectly targeted ad space. Positions: LEAPS + earnings lotto tickets because life is short.

The Story So Far

You beautiful regards remember when META crashed to $88 in 2022? When everyone thought Apple's ""privacy"" changes and TikTok would kill Zuck? Instead, META got lean, mean, and is now setting up to absolutely dominate the AI era.

Why META's About to Print More Money Than The Fed

The secret isn't just that META has AI - everyone has AI now. It's that META's entire business is perfectly positioned to turn AI into cold hard cash immediately, not years from now.

Think about it: META already has the best ad targeting in the game. They survived Apple's privacy nuke because they have so much first-party data that they can still figure out exactly what you want to buy. Now they're adding generative AI to create infinite variations of ads, test them in real-time, and scale the winners instantly. The more ads they test, the more data they get, the better it gets - it's a feedback loop that literally can't go tits up.

But here's where it gets really juicy: META isn't just using AI for ads. They're testing AI-generated content in feeds, and word is the tests are absolutely crushing it. Every single piece of content - whether made by AI or humans - becomes potential ad space. See an influencer wearing a dope jacket? AI spots it, tags it, makes it purchasable. That random landscape in your feed? Might have been generated by AI specifically because you're likely to buy what's in it.

And this is just the beginning. While everyone else is trying to figure out how to make money from AI, META's already doing it. Their 8 million advertisers (mostly small businesses that live and die by META's platform) are about to get access to god-tier ad creative tools. Nobody else has this combination of data, infrastructure, and direct path to monetization.

The Long Game Is Even Better:

Their AR prototype (Orion) is apparently insane, and with AI generating UI/UX on the fly, every real-world object becomes ad space. But here's the thing: you don't even need to believe in the AR/VR future to be bullish. The AI ad money printer works just fine without it.

Positions and Price Action:

LEAPS (2025/2026) are the obvious play here for maximum tendies with managed risk. Shares if you're boring. And because I like to live dangerously, some 615c FDs for earnings tomorrow.

Remember: This is a company that nuked their stock with the ""metaverse"" pivot, got bodied by Apple's privacy changes, dealt with TikTok eating their lunch - and still came out stronger. Now they're first in line to monetize AI at scale."
Altria Group (MO) Earnings Play 10/31,1730215879.0,15,1gexfcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gexfcm/altria_group_mo_earnings_play_1031/,17,"Altria Group, (MO) is one of the largest companies in the U.S. tobacco and nicotine industry, most famous for the Marlboro brand. Over the years, Altria hasn’t just stuck with traditional cigarettes but has also spread into new markets and products to stay competitive and relevant.

https://preview.redd.it/zyd7wmc0vkxd1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e1797e37b5796381ee1343e0bc80ae9d94612ce

**Key Products**

Altria’s main business is tobacco, and Marlboro is the superstar here, holding one of the largest shares of the U.S. cigarette market. While cigarette sales have declined, Altria’s pricing strategies and cost management keep this segment solid.

**New Growth Areas**

Altria has smartly expanded into new product types to adapt to changing consumer preferences:

* **Smokeless Tobacco**: They own brands like **Copenhagen** and **Skoal**, giving fans of chewing or dipping tobacco solid options.
* **Nicotine Pouches**: Through Helix Innovations, they’ve also got **On! nicotine pouches**, which are smokeless, spit-free, and appealing to people looking for alternatives to smoking.

https://preview.redd.it/xoaat7uhvkxd1.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=6eeb9a01e7df79ad177b9df6b107c4f04943c92f

**Alternative Nicotine Products**

Altria’s not just about cigarettes. They’ve invested in **JUUL Labs** (owning 35%), diving into the e-cigarette market despite JUUL’s regulatory ups and downs. They also acquired **NJOY Holdings**, which offers the NJOY ACE, the only FDA-authorized menthol e-vapor option on the market. Plus, Altria distributes **IQOS**, a heated tobacco product that’s marketed as a less harmful alternative to regular cigarettes, in partnership with Philip Morris International.

**Cannabis Potential**

Altria holds a 45% stake in **Cronos Group**, a Canadian cannabis company, giving them a foothold in the growing cannabis industry as legalization spreads in North America.

**Reliable Dividends**

Altria is known for its high dividends, typically offering a yield of 7-8%, which is significantly higher than average. They aim to pay out about 80% of their earnings to shareholders, and they’ve increased their dividend 58 times over the past 55 years, with the latest bump in August.

**Recent Stock Action**

Altria missed its earnings estimate last quarter, which caused a brief dip in the stock, but it bounced back to hit a 52-week high of $54 before stabilizing at $50. While cigarette sales continue to decline slowly, Altria’s shift to smoke-free options and reduced-risk products is steadily gaining momentum, positioning the company well for the future.

Philip Morris and Altria stocks often move in sync. Last week, Philip Morris reported outstanding earnings, sending its stock up more than 10% in a big rally. That’s positive momentum for Altria too, as investors typically see these two companies as closely linked in the tobacco industry.

These could pull more merchants in and make Shopify the ultimate hub for global e-commerce. Plus, they’re throwing in AI-driven tools to streamline sales, boost engagement, and generally look fancy. If they play this right, the growth potential is insane.

3. **Lean and Mean Financials**: Shopify reported $2.05 billion in Q2 2024 revenue, up 21% YOY, and managed to pump its gross margin to 51%. Plus, they slashed operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from 65% to 37%. They’re not just blowing cash—they’re actually making some, with a free cash flow margin at 16.3%. Financially, they’re holding it down and keeping expenses in check, which is honestly a big W in this market.

4. **High Rollers + International Plays**: Shopify Plus, their premium tier, is now 31% of their Monthly Recurring Revenue—big players with big wallets are signing up. And the international expansion? Shopify’s making moves into untapped markets, positioning itself as a one-stop shop for both B2B and B2C. Compared to Square, which mostly sticks to POS and payments, Shopify’s fully integrated, which is like leveling up in the e-commerce game.

5. **Margin Gains - Dumped the Dead Weight**: Shopify finally bailed on its logistics business, which was dragging down margins. Now, they’re focused on what they do best: tech and e-commerce. That move boosted Subscription Solutions’ gross margin to 83%. They’re all in on high-margin, high-growth areas now, which could be a winning formula long term.

# The Bear Case: ""Don’t Bet the Farm""

1. **Current Price Feels Hefty**: Shopify’s trading at a 27% premium to its current fair value, and its Price/Free Cash Flow multiple is sitting at a lofty 58. Translation? Shopify ain’t cheap. For this to pay off, they’ve gotta keep delivering growth AND margin expansion, or it could get ugly real quick in a crowded space.

2. **Competition’s Got Its Fangs Out**: Shopify’s going head-to-head with Amazon, Square, and even Oracle. The competition here is stacked, and it’s not cheap to keep marketing expenses high enough to hold its ground. Plus, if the economy pulls back, Shopify’s core customers—small and medium businesses—might have to pump the brakes on spending, which could crush that sweet, sweet recurring revenue.

3. **Upcoming Q3 Earnings - Brace for Impact:** Shopify’s Q3 projections are solid—total revenue around $2.05 billion, EPS growth up 50% YOY. But if they miss? This stock could drop faster than a meme stock on a Tuesday morning. The current valuation has a lot of optimism baked in, so they better deliver or investors could start jumping ship.

# Final Verdict

Shopify is set up nicely as one of the biggest e-commerce plays out there. They’re making serious bank, their international and B2B game is on point, and they’re building a cash machine with that margin expansion. For those of us looking at the long game, Shopify’s potential in a monster market could make this a top-tier buy. But you better be ready for some turbulence because at this price, it’s high-risk, high-reward.

**TL;DR**: Shopify’s a big dog in e-commerce with plenty of room to run but isn’t cheap. It’s a high-growth, high-risk stock in a huge market. You’ll either be sipping champagne or holding a bag on this one—trade with caution.

**DISCLAIMER:** Don’t throw your life savings at this based on one DD. Manage your risk, don’t go all in, and keep that stop loss in check.

**Personal position**

I will start by purchasing 100 shares of Shopify as a medium- to long-term investment.

"AMD Q3 Preview: EPS Jumps 30% YoY, Close Gap with Nvidia?",1730196815.0,35,1ger3tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ger3tf/amd_q3_preview_eps_jumps_30_yoy_close_gap_with/,6,"AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year.

This report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. 

Although AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables.

**Data Center Growth is Key**

Analysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. 

Earlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance.

Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp."

MSFT Call with earnings around the corner!,1730213993.0,7,1gewokg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gewokg/msft_call_with_earnings_around_the_corner/,9,"Hey fellow investors! 🎉 If you’re eyeing the 11/1 $435 MSFT call, you’re not alone. Let’s dive into why this option might be a savvy choice right now.
1. Microsoft’s Strong Performance
Microsoft has been on a roll lately, with strong earnings reports and continued growth in key sectors like cloud computing and AI. This momentum could push the stock price closer to that $435 mark, making this call option potentially lucrative.
2. Premium Potential
Options with higher implied volatility tend to offer attractive premiums. Given Microsoft’s recent market activity, there’s a good chance you could earn a nice premium on this call. This can be a great way to generate additional income, especially if you’re already holding MSFT shares.
3. Bullish Sentiment
If you’re bullish on Microsoft but don’t expect the stock to skyrocket overnight, this call option allows you to benefit from moderate upward movements. It’s a way to leverage your positive outlook without committing to buying more shares outright.
4. Downside Protection
While selling calls limits your upside potential, it also offers some downside protection. The premium you receive can effectively lower your cost basis, cushioning any potential dips in the stock price.
5. Strategic Timing
With the expiration date just around the corner on November 1st, this short-term play could align well with upcoming market catalysts or company announcements. Timing is everything in options trading, and this could be an opportunity to capitalize on near-term movements.
Final Thoughts
As always, it’s crucial to do your own research and consider your risk tolerance before diving into any options trade. But if you’re confident in Microsoft’s trajectory and looking for a way to enhance your portfolio’s performance, the 11/1 $435 MSFT call might just be worth considering.

Celsius Holdings: Poor Man's Call (LEAPS) opportunity,1730183658.0,30,1geo9gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1geo9gp/celsius_holdings_poor_mans_call_leaps_opportunity/,19,"Celsius Holdings Inc is a manufacturer and distributor of energy/fitness drinks. In the US market, it is at spot #3 [behind Red Bull & Monster].

The stock has falled from highs of 90$ in May, 2024 to 31$ on 28th October, 2024. The company gave lower guidance for Q3 as its long term distribution partner signalled that it has stocked more than the actual demand. This led analysts to believe that the product has matured and will face slower growth/stagnation in coming quarters.

The company's balance sheet is healthy with considerable cash and EPS (diluted) at 0.28$.
*If you are interested to learn more then please visit the investor section in the Celsius Holdings website.

The stock has found a strong support at 28-29$ zone and currently is in the consolidation phase. This consolidation phase may last several weeks as market re assess the stock during 5th November earnings call.

Energy drinks market is still increasing. Health conscious consumers to ditching sugar drinks in favour of nutrients and vitamins packed drinks. This trend is expected to continue and even pick pace in coming months & years.

How to play?

Upon expiry of weekly short call, sell another weekly OTM call option. Continue this till the stock starts inching up.

It's been one year since I bought my last batch of LEAPS. Here's the basic rundown of my strategy:

1. stocks only go up\*

2. when stocks go up calls go up more\*\*

3. hold calls for at least 1 year (LEAPS) to pay less on capital gains tax

  \* usually

  \*\* sometimes

Now that we have the best strategy to maximize our gains we should also take a few steps to minimize our  losses. No matter how many gains you get it's all over if you multiply by 0 a single time. The best way to avoid that is with diversification.

four-step diversification process:

1. buy calls on etfs instead of stocks so any one company can't bankrupt you

2. buy different etfs WITH LOW CORRELATION. I considered hedging QQQ with SPY but...

https://preview.redd.it/hi0kdnskpjxd1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e4283533b12dc738964d3e619aa7ef37593bd1

it wouldn't be much of a hedge at all at .84 correlation. Instead I went with XLP:

https://preview.redd.it/z4xsm39ppjxd1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f977779a87e372d3f2668c2f393b1274e204e1d

3. buy calls at different expiration dates so you don't get blown up by one freak event (like March 2020)

4. leave some money ""on the sidelines"" (in QQQ shares) so you can still buy the dip if stocks go down or sideways for 2 or more years

With those rules in mind the two etfs I picked were QQQ and XLP as the LEAPS offerings were pretty limited on Robinhood 6 years ago and these two backtested the best given my strategy.  


""Show all time""

Robinhood's all time chart sucks and makes it look like I started with 160k in 2018. I actually started with 3k and made steady deposits every few months since then.

https://preview.redd.it/7fimq74iqjxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=866eadc4b89dbfa6040c708247a0db8f83ef600d

If you wanted to see the real %return of my strategy over the past 6 years you would have to track every buy, sell, deposit, and withdrawal so you could adjust the % gains based on my total cost basis at the time... which I attempted here: [Supplemental Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/lightStoleMyName/comments/1geawok/an_attempt_at_adjusting_total_return_for_deposits/)

In the end it was more like +350% all time for a 27% average annual return. Compared to QQQ shares in the same timeframe (+160% for 15% annual) it's not half bad. Compare it to TQQQ on the other hand (+390%) and yeah maybe I'm just massively over-complicating the process of getting leverage. As expected QQQ calls outperformed by a lot accounting for 180k of my gains but my underperforming XLP calls (just 78k of gains) are the price I pay for being a wuss.

Below is the screenshot after selling everything that was up for long term gains cuz I know you're supposed to sell for a gain post. The QQQ calls are staying a litter longer because technically I bought them on Oct 27 but the dividend event makes robinhood mark them as Dec 28th so I wanna be real sure they won't miss-categorize them as short term capital gains before I sell. I reached out to customer support at 10:00AM and they'll ""check with the back office team and email me within the hour""

TLDR: everyone is a genius in a bull market and this is just one way of getting leverage, but it's my way and I like it."

Many of the mistakes and losses I made came from my emotions taking over. Along with my bad exits most trades despite having great setups resulted in losses. 

I began to do some backtesting on SPY. (YTD 15 min timeframe) I noticed that after each entry SPY would move make a one point move or greater most times. (81 trades YTD 6 losses of about 4-5 points and 76 trades for a one point gain). I didn't notice this before as I would try to capture as big a move as possible each trade.

there is speculation already on twitter today. but I have what is pretty much as close as it gets to proof.

check out this guy's video. he is deeply close with Apple. He a suck-up total apple dickrider. has visited the campus and done multiple interviews with execs. It must be an open secret on the inside because he knew. He just had this slip where he introduces John Ternus as ""c- svp of hardware engineering"" at the 00:16 minute mark. And then Ternus catches the almost slip, and smiles.

He then uploads the unedited clip anyway. If apple wanted to keep it airtight they would make him edit that part out before uploading. It's him.

The Case for Buying Alibaba Puts: A Strategic Investment Approach,1730241941.0,2,1gf7rz6,https://i.redd.it/vsm4nimmxrxd1.jpeg,7,"As one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, Alibaba Group Holding Limited has long been a favorite among investors. However, recent developments in the global economy, regulatory environment, and the company’s own financial performance have raised concerns about its future. This essay outlines several reasons why purchasing put options on Alibaba stock could be a strategic investment decision.

1. Regulatory Pressures and Government Scrutiny

One of the most significant risks facing Alibaba is the increasing regulatory scrutiny from the Chinese government. Since late 2020, the Chinese government has implemented a series of crackdowns on major technology companies, including Alibaba, aimed at curbing monopolistic practices and increasing consumer protection. This regulatory environment has created uncertainty surrounding the company’s operational capabilities and future profitability. By purchasing puts, investors can hedge against potential declines in Alibaba’s stock price resulting from adverse regulatory decisions or further governmental interference.

2. Economic Slowdown in China

China’s economy has shown signs of slowing down, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent lockdown measures. Economic indicators such as GDP growth, consumer spending, and retail sales have exhibited a downward trend, impacting the e-commerce sector directly. As a company heavily reliant on consumer spending, Alibaba’s revenues may be adversely affected if economic conditions do not improve. By buying put options, investors can profit from a potential decline in Alibaba’s stock price as consumer confidence wanes and economic conditions worsen.

3. Competitive Landscape

The competitive environment for Alibaba has become increasingly fierce. Domestic competitors, such as JD.com and Pinduoduo, are gaining market share and challenging Alibaba’s dominance in various segments of e-commerce. Additionally, international players are beginning to make inroads into the Chinese market. This heightened competition can lead to reduced margins and decreased market share for Alibaba, thereby negatively impacting its stock performance. Purchasing puts allows investors to capitalize on potential declines in stock value as competitive pressures mount.

4. Global Market Conditions

Alibaba’s performance is also influenced by global market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. Rising interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing, affecting consumer spending and business investments. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, can lead to market volatility and uncertainty, further impacting Alibaba’s stock. As investors grow more risk-averse in such an environment, Alibaba’s stock may face downward pressure, making puts a strategic choice to hedge against potential declines.

5. Financial Performance and Earnings Risks

Despite its size and reach, Alibaba has faced challenges in delivering consistent financial performance. Recent earnings reports have shown fluctuations in revenue growth, with some segments underperforming expectations. If these trends continue, they could lead to disappointing earnings announcements that result in sharp declines in the stock price. By buying puts, investors can protect themselves from these risks and profit if the stock does drop following negative earnings news.

6. Market Sentiment and Investor Behavior

Market sentiment can play a crucial role in stock performance. As negative news surrounding regulatory issues and economic conditions spreads, investor confidence in Alibaba may decline. A shift in sentiment can lead to a rapid sell-off, further driving down the stock price. By purchasing put options, investors position themselves to benefit from such declines, capitalizing on market behavior rather than relying solely on fundamental analysis.

7. Risk Management Strategy

Investing in put options on Alibaba serves as a risk management strategy, allowing investors to protect their portfolios. The ability to limit potential losses while still having the opportunity to profit from a downturn makes puts an appealing option for those wary of the risks associated with Alibaba. By establishing a position in puts, investors can safeguard against broader market movements or company-specific risks that may lead to significant losses.

Conclusion

While Alibaba remains a major player in the global e-commerce space, various factors indicate potential challenges ahead. Regulatory pressures, economic slowdowns, competitive threats, financial performance issues, and negative market sentiment all contribute to an environment ripe for investment caution. Buying put options on Alibaba stock offers investors a strategic avenue to hedge against potential declines while allowing them to manage risk effectively. In an unpredictable market, such strategies can be crucial for navigating the complexities of investment decisions."

This offering is good for HOOD (nice rhyme) but great for IBKR. As an avid IBKR long (up 27% on shares YTD), this pleases me to see. I was worried that HOOD’s offering would take market share from IBKR but that won’t matter either way if IBKR owns the infrastructure. Long IBKR - fantastic company. I like it much better than HOOD on a long term basis for many reasons, and this is now one of those reasons. However, both companies can win and grow in their own ways. Plenty of success for both, IMO. IBKR is up 75% YTD, HOOD is up 100%+. I guess the lesson here folks, is to buy your broker. "

Chariot Mining Corp (ASX:CC9),1730233088.0,0,1gf4d2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gf4d2s/chariot_mining_corp_asxcc9/,1,"I’ve yet to see any discussion threads regarding this stock anywhere as of the last year or so. This is an Australian mining company that has recently purchased rights to mine lithium in the Black Mountains of Wyoming. If you follow the news you probably have seen a bunch of Forrest fires ravaging that exact area (coincidence? I think not). Ended up purchasing some shares, but that is not my point. Considering the well timed fires following the recent acquirement of mining rights, I am under the impression that this company may have some help from the people behind the scenes. So I’d like to think they’ve got a slight advantage over competitors. I had similar success during Covid trading health stocks that benefited from the pandemic (Honeywell, Kimberly Clark, etc.).


  1. Has anyone else purchased this or had their eyes on this company?
2. There was a recent trading halt followed by a steep drop in price, will this affect long term value positively or negatively?
3. Do you think there is any possibility of this company going public on the NYSE? (There is currently an active ticker for the company on the NYSE but no shares traded yet)
4. Despite Chariots recent volatility, are big things to come in the future?

TLDR - will this be a failed experiment or do you think there’s potential upside for this company? What are your thoughts?"

TL;DR: We're entering an unprecedented technological acceleration where AI capabilities are advancing exponentially. Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.

**The Thesis:**

We are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:

**Key Technical Developments:**

* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints
* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities
* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)
* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)

Business Implications:

1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.
2. Follow the Money:
   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually
   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today’s dollars
   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets
   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment
3. The Economics Are Compelling:
   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue
   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt
   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)

  
**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:

[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)

* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:

[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)

   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% 
   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% 
   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%
   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% 
   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% 
* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:

https://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf

   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA
   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR
   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:
      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters
* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):
   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout
   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.

  


 **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**

There's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\[1\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\[2\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   
I've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. "

Doubling down on RIVN,1730140413.0,95,1ge9hl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ge9hl2/doubling_down_on_rivn/,78,"I've always been bullish on RIVN but after getting a car, it's clear to me they know how to make an absolutely impressive product and as price drops (with the release of R2 & R3 lines), they'll win market share.

  
A few things that stand out to me:

1. RIV is currently trading around 11BN market cap w/ $7+bn cash on hand as of Q2

2. Investment in VW, the subsequent launch of Scout (which looks to be a lot of Riv tech) an the closing of VW Germany shows me that RIV could be a huge piece of VW's play (currently $50BN market cap)

3. Growing # of F500's using RIV truck as fleet, not a lot of competition here

4. TSLA added $150BN+ of market cap last week due to an amazing quarter amongst other things. That market swing is 15x Rivians total market cap. Shows me a LOT of potential for RIVN

  
Anything else I'm missing on the pros side? Any major cons to have a healthy debate?"

LAC & IONR Cheap stocks with potential.,1730160049.0,22,1geh7v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1geh7v0/lac_ionr_cheap_stocks_with_potential/,22,"Loan of $2.2B to LAC from US DoE approved. Phase one to produce 40k metric tons of lithium carbonate per year. October price average of $10k/mt. That's $400m/year. LAC is backed by GM which will purchase 38% ownership at $625m.

Both are out in the middle of a desert and Biden last week approved Ioneer. 

Ioneer  received $700m loan from DoE. Mine to produce 22k metric tons per year. Backed by SBSW ($490m in equity); Ford, Toyota, and Panasonic have agreed to buy lithium from them.

LAC's mine is already under construction and will start producing sometime in 2026. Ioneer will begin construction in 2025 and won't produce until about 2028.

Neither political party will opposed due to there currently being one lithium mine in the US and the general mood of F China. Both mines have a life expectancy of at least 20 years upwards of 30 years.

Currently, lithium carbonate is in a slump due to China's oversupply of batteries and drop in EVs sales; falling from its high of $79,000 per metric ton in Dec 22, to October price of $10,000. Prices are expected to stabilize and increase to $15-17k in the next year.

But demand is expected to continue to rise far beyond current supplies. 2024 predicted to produce 1.3 million tons (with an over supply of 100k tons) and 2030 demand is expected to be 3 million tons. By 2040 demand is expected to at least double 2030 demand.

Even at current prices, mining lithium carbonate is still very profitable. Prices are expected to stabilize and increase slightly.


TL:DR
Pros: Demand is going to increase steadily for the next decade or more. Even at current prices mines are profitable. The West hates China and finance new mines. Almost all governments on Earth are pushing EVs.

Cons: China is attempting to dominate the market by ~stealing~ politely taking from Africa. African mines plus unregulated 3rd world country's mines could cause short term oversupply. Long, long term potential for recycling of lithium to cause drop in mining demands.


Bonus:
Copper demand is also expected to skyrocket as it is a main component in electronics and EV batteries.

Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

""A record number of banks are now reporting that they’re working with state-legal marijuana businesses amid increased pressure on Congress to enact broader protections for financial institutions interested in servicing the cannabis industry and as the Biden administration’s rescheduling proposal advances, new federal data shows.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has been tracking cannabis banking trends for the past decade, and its latest report for the second quarter of 2024 shows a record high, with 831 banks and credit unions reporting their active involvement with marijuana companies.

That’s up from 815 in the first quarter of 2024 and 799 in the prior quarter.

There are several possible factors that could help explain the increase in banks working with cannabis businesses, including the expansion of state marijuana markets as more legalization laws have taken effect over time. It’s also possible financial institutions are more willing to navigate the space as congressional lawmakers across the aisle continue to discuss their shared interest in advancing codified protections for banks under the Secure and Fair Enforcement Regulation (SAFER) Banking Act.

That legislation cleared a Senate committee last year, but it’s still pending floor action. With limited time left this session—and competing legislative priorities during an election year—the chances that it moves through the Senate and GOP-controlled House this year are unclear at best, however.""

It's an interesting development to see now that there are banking institutions willing to work with cannabis companies, even though SAFER hasn't been passed through Congress yet, it tells us that some banks are willing to take the risk of working with these companies even though cannabis remains federally illegal, maybe it could be a sign that banks are seeing the sector favorably to make businesses with in the future.

Positions: 1000 shares of MSOS @ 7.69 average, I really want to see how the sector will look like after this election is over.

With the central bank easing and the economy performing well, the outlook for many companies is improving.

According to Bank of America, mentions of a ""bottom"" in earnings reports this season have risen by 56% compared to a year ago. Historically, such references have preceded broader improvements in earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/m6qf4qifnpxd1.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d77b0a2e916b08264f1f445ade15492792c241

Notably, cyclical companies—those whose prospects closely align with the economy—are well represented among those reporting. If earnings in this sector begin to improve, it would be a positive development for investors concerned about the current tech-heavy market, which has seen a series of record highs this year.

Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management, stated, ""We feel that third-quarter earnings for many cyclical companies represent a bottom. This doesn't mean we're poised for a surge in earnings estimates, but it does give us confidence that the situation isn't likely to worsen.""

Bank of America strategists noted in an October 28 report that companies have faced weak demand for nearly two years due to challenges in the goods and manufacturing sectors. However, they see signs that the worst may be behind us. They anticipate a healthy recovery in these sectors next year, which should boost earnings per share.

**Consumer Sentiment Reinforces The Objectivity**

U.S. consumer sentiment reinforces this perspective. The University of Michigan's final October sentiment index rose to 70.5, up from 70.1 in September and a preliminary reading of 68.9

https://preview.redd.it/f0gulvflnpxd1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=df992c755387f0da5bf2f599e17ad6c6476d415d

Expectations for income increased to their highest level since June, and respondents expressed greater optimism about the job market, with over half anticipating further interest rate relief this year. This suggests that consumer spending will remain resilient, supporting the economy.

Strong consumer confidence can drive increased spending, leading to improved profits for public companies, creating a positive feedback loop. Rising profits will likely reflect in stock prices, which remains the main theme for investing in the U.S. market."

"Google Q3 Earnings Preview: Advertising, Cloud and Capex",1730127030.0,42,1ge3xvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ge3xvv/google_q3_earnings_preview_advertising_cloud_and/,16,"Google is set to announce its Q3 earnings on October 29th, after U.S. markets close. Here are key focal points:

https://preview.redd.it/cr5hbq1wfixd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff6f4e0fed7df1b00513c9079e04ecc89b8b18f

**Advertising:**

Google remains the world's undisputed leader in search. Data shows that as of September 30th, Google's web traffic rose 1% from the previous quarter, reaching 2.7 billion visits, while Bing, its closest competitor, saw a 3% drop to just 58 million visits. Google's daily active users (DAU) for Q3 grew about 1% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year.

However, even Google must remain vigilant. Google's search dominance is being challenged as fast-rising competitors like TikTok and Amazon capture market share. In fact, Google's share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to dip below 50% next year—a first in over a decade.

**Google Cloud:**

In the second quarter, Alphabet's results revenue from Google Cloud surged 28% YoY. Can such high growth be sustained? Let's wait and see.

**YouTube:**

YouTube outpaced Instagram and TikTok in DAU growth over the last quarter. In July, August, and September, YouTube maintained positive DAU growth, while its three main competitors saw declines. Additionally, YouTube extended the maximum length of Shorts from 1 minute to 3 minutes, improving monetization potential.

**Other Growth Areas:**

Alphabet has several potential revenue drivers that have yet to impact its bottom line. Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, has partnered with Uber to offer driverless rides in Atlanta and Austin. Additionally, Alphabet's Cloud division, which posted $10 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating profit in Q2, holds strong growth potential.

**Capital Expenditure:**

In July, CEO Sundar Pichai stated, ""The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us."" However, Wall Street's patience is limited; investors are looking for returns on AI investments sooner rather than later. Progress in AI commercialization will be a key focus in this earnings report.

**Antitrust Concerns:**

The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Google, hinting at a potential breakup. However, history suggests that forced breakups are rare. Google's relatively low valuation already reflects the policy risks it faces."

Next week is one of the busiest earnings weeks for this year with >150 S&P 500 companies reporting Q3 earnings. It's also time for making the biggest plays to get that elusive 5-20x returns!

Now the important question is which ones to play to make money and limit losses? I did some research/TA and found few interesting plays which are worth looking into. All my plays are based on TA/past earnings insights. My goal is to keep most of the plays with $200-$500 (exceptions big tech), so that even if I am wrong, I am not busting my entire account on couple of plays. 

This is part 1 of the series focusing on earnings of 10/28 and 10/29 (bmo). 

Of course, do your own research and don't blindly follow any regard like me online. I work in Wendy's and eat crayons for dinner.

**1. VFC**: Another regard did an entire post on this company, so I won't go into details. Based on its chart, I am bearish to neutral on it. It has recently broken its uptrend and is now heading for gap fill at $14. So this is my plan:

* Buy 2 15p Nov15, 2024: $100 
* If you want to hedge and save your dick in this pumps, buy 20c Dec20, 2024: $50 
* **Expected profit: $200/200%** (excl. hedge)

[VFC has broken the uptrend and looks good for $14 gap fill](https://preview.redd.it/eua4kpqf8dxd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1ca94e55b0c6b093518cc464bb360625ef77ba)

**2. PYPL:** One of WSB old favorites!! This has been on a strong upward run since end of July with \~40% up. However, the chart looks overextended in short term with 50 SMA close to 75 and gap fill around \~74. Also showing bearish divergence with RSI trending lower and price going up! I am bearish on it for the short term.

Here's my plan:

* Buy 70p Dec20, 2024: $110 (buying more time in case this goes up for short term but turns down after election)
* To hedge, buy 100c Dec20, 2024: $70 
* **Expected returns: $122/112%** (excl. hedge)

[Pypl gap fill at $74 ](https://preview.redd.it/ewi5ylohkdxd1.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=81fceffa17008fa1842c12b2c2b09c05b2e7d0ec)

**3. RCL:** Royal Caribbean is a monster stock and money printer for the last few years. Unlike CCL and NCLH, this is one of the best cruise stock to own. While I like this company, it's setup is very similar to PYPL. Overextended on the short term, bearish divergence on RSI, gap fill at $185. I am bearish on it for the short term.

Here's my plan:

* Buy 180p Nov15, 2024: $170 
* To hedge, buy 220c Nov1, 2024: $75 
* **Expected profit: $284/171%** (excl. hedge)

[RCL gap fill at $184](https://preview.redd.it/si10wtbapdxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b902040d2d3ee469918ee04035e6ceab89757b70)

I will be posting my positions in comments on Monday morning when I buy these options. Posting it earlier for all of you to make more tendies! I chose at least 2 weeks expiry for all my plays, you can make far more (or lose more) if you gamble weeklies!!

TLDR: **VFC, PYPL, RCL go down, buy puts!🚀🚀🚀🚀**

"$CHGG – Deep Value, Overlooked",1730131651.0,0,1ge5v8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ge5v8e/chgg_deep_value_overlooked/,44,"**TL;DR:** With a sales multiple of 2, Chegg is priced like the company is going out of business soon, but the company’s financial situation makes this seem unlikely. They have cash on hand and are ready to plug away at their position and have made strategic partnerships with AI companies to enhance their business amidst technological changes. The stock is clearly undervalued and I currently have a price target of $5.

Background Information:

Chegg is a subscription service for students to help them with their homework and study. Subscribers have access to curated answers to homework problems and other study materials. This company once had a market cap of 12 billion in 2021 and has been beaten down to a market cap of 170 million as of 10/23/2024.

Macroeconomic factors:

The main factor bringing this stock down is the rise of AI and widely available LLMs. This investment thesis has dominated the sentiment around this stock, as Chegg has regressed a little bit in their subscription revenue (down 11% YOY) and laid off about 20% of their staff.

https://preview.redd.it/2s567mr0tixd1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=030c183698ac104d84a8a47ff09474c8055a9a0d

Despite all of this, Chegg as a company has taken this on the chin. They have an existing partnership with OpenAI and their language education division (Busuu) has recently announced they are using AI in their service to simulate real conversations in other languages. Chegg is not backing down but attempting to evolve in the changing marketplace.

Anecdotally, I know many people that still use Chegg in college and know of fraternities that buy Chegg subscriptions for their members. With Chegg’s earnings coming up, even the smallest sign of life is due to send the stock soaring.

Financial Statement Analysis:

When I saw this stock’s history, I assumed their financial statements must be an absolute mess. However, Chegg is actually in a decent financial situation. Chegg has $340 million more in assets than liabilities. Their revenue is approximately $100 million a year, meaning hypothetically, as an extreme example, if Chegg were to use all of its revenue for buybacks, they could buyback half of the shares outstanding at their current valuation. I was initially shocked when I saw they had lost $600 million in the last 12 months in assets, until I realized this was because the company has written off almost $600 million in goodwill, which is maybe the best-case scenario for a huge loss like. I am not super worried about that. Chegg is currently holding $133 million in cash. Their current ratio is 0.9. To be sure, their adjusted EBITDA is down 27%, but part of this is due to a decrease in share-based compensation which I believe is a good thing.

https://preview.redd.it/kfd75uq5tixd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7068183088c24e85546d103c4b13253f2ad18535

Financial Metrics:

This is where things start to get really attractive. Chegg is trading at a 2x multiple sales multiple. Their forward P/E is 1.7 and EV/EBITDA is 3. Chegg is clearly priced as if they are going to go out of business very soon, which is absurd given their position on their balance sheet. Sure, they're not in the best position possible, and the stock definitely deserves to be beaten down from their al-time high, but their current valuation is dirt cheap. Selling ice to Eskimos kind of cheap, which absurd given their ability to pivot. This is clearly an overreaction to the hype of AI and their small decline in revenue compared to their decline in valuation

Short Interest:

Currently 14% of the float and 11% of the shares outstanding are being shorted. This, I believe, is the main reason why there is such a huge discrepancy between the company’s market valuation and true performance. 

My Positions:

For full transparency, I own about 5.5k shares, 50x Jan 17 2025 $4 Calls, and 15x Dec 19 2025 $5 Calls.

My 100x companies 🤜📈,1729987865.0,916,1gcyo9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gcyo9q/my_100x_companies/,357,"First off, for a company to potentially 100x, it has to be truly revolutionary to the point where no one believes in it. And that is what I love. I have mentioned a few of these in previous posts (my largest being IONQ) and got shit on for it. Since that post, it has doubled (177 days). Whether you agree or not, this post is mostly a way for me to combine my research and give others opportunities. Remember you can only lose 100% but make infinite. I don’t expect anyone to believe in these stocks now, but check back in 5 years. 



So with that, 



Company number 1: **IONQ**. (I have made this post before but my confidence is so strong in IONQ that others need to hear it again)



IONQ is a company in the quantum computing industry and the reason I’m bullish on it is due to its positioning in the quantum industry. Unlike other companies such as IBM, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN and others, IONQ is able to create incredibly accurate qubits. 



What is quantum computing and qubits?



Quantum computing utilizes qubits rather than the conventional bits in computing to solve the most complex problems. A bit is the binary value of 1 or 0 that stores data. Qubits by themselves are not interesting but that data it holds can be held in a state of superposition. This allows the qubit to be in a way, in every possible form. Once groups of these are in superposition, that data is in multidimensional space. That may sound complicated but imagine a normal computer has its bits in 2d space whereas quantum computing pushes that to the 3rd or 4th dimension allowing the data to be in every configuration. That’s just a basic quantum computer. Now to actually use these computers and qubits to solve complex problems, you must fire microwaves photons at them. The photons essentially tell it what position to be in. To change shape and read the info from that new position. 



What does IONQ do that’s special?



Well IONQ has made incredibly accurate and stable qubits. Nature has created natural quantum systems in atoms that IONQ has been able to ionize and isolate. Because of that IONQ uses the naturally occurring quantum systems to create their qubits. 



Other companies such as IBM have revolutionized other areas of computing. IBM has used their chips to improve error correction of output data. GOOG is maximizing the number of qubits. AMZN also focused on error correction and the overall accuracy of its computing. MSFT focuses on quantum algorithms. Basically no other company has been able to produce and scale accurate qubits. (This is different than IBM because IBM needs the tech to limit errors whereas IONQ’s qubits practically have no errors to begin with)



Why quantum computing could be the future.



1: Quantum computing has the potential to simply solve exponentially more challenging problems at a much faster rate. This will be used in our everyday life from shipping routes to electric vehicle batteries development. Any problem can be solved quicker and more accurately.  

2: Quantum computing currently sits at an industry value of around 600 million with expectation for 9 billion in 2030. That’s the compounded annual growth so a breakthrough could yield a much higher potential industry value

3: IONQ has investors including Kia, Google, Fidelity, Hyundai, and a couple firms. As well as being partnered with Amazon. Its investors stemming from automobiles to banking shows the belief in the possibilities of quantum computing. 

4: Quantum computers are just cool. They sound cool, they look cool, and who doesn’t love cool. If you haven’t seen one I highly recommend looking it up. 







Company number 2: **NuScale Power Corp (SMR)** 



We are just beginning to understand and even implement the extensive uses of nuclear energy. We are reaching undeniably dangerous levels of climate change due to constant greenhouse emissions due to growing populations, economies, and countries. Now these emissions come from producing out necessities which first stem from energy. Energy is everything. Everyone knows fossil fuels are simply bad for the environment but to what extent? Well to the extent that if we want humankind to live over 50 more years, we NEED to limit these emissions. And that is where nuclear energy comes in. Nuclear energy releases nearly zero emissions yet is roughly 8000 times more efficient than fossil fuels. So that begs the question, why don’t we solely use nuclear energy? It was unstable and unfeasible to main stream it. Until now.



SMR is in the works of finalizing and streamlining its small modular reactors. Previously power plants required large plots of land, large mantience crews, and came with high risks of meltdown and the effects that come with that. However, SMR has cut down every single one of those factors. 



Now why would you invest in futuristic nuclear fission without understanding it. Well here is is simply put if you have taken a high school chemistry course. A neutron is released into a stable collection of uranium atoms which when collide and produce extreme amounts of energy taking the form of heat. Once one uranium atom splits, it releases more neutrons creating a chain reaction. This heat is then pressurized into steam which is used to create power. Now SMR submerges their reactors in water to provide consistent coolant during the reaction further within a room lined with seismic category 1 aircraft impact resistant structures. Now they also employ many more safety protocols to minimize the chance of a nuclear meltdown and the reaction of that to nearly zero.



So, why is nuclear energy and SMR simply creating the future?



1: We will NEED nuclear energy if we want to continue to grow as a species without killing the climate and ourself

2: SMR has innovated a way to scale nuclear power plants to make them economically viable for everyone and for our main supplier of power. 

3: SMR has large investors including Google, Amazon, potentially Microsoft, and I’m sure many more (no other investors were public information). 



Also, a similar stock to SMR that I’m also investing in is OKLO. They are similar to SMR just appear to be in the earlier stages of entering the nuclear energy market (which I love). 







Company number 3: **AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)**



Im sure you have heard of ASTS through this subreddit, and probably think you already missed your chance ton invest. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. 



ASTS is a company building the first ever global cellular network in space that allows 4G/5G connection from anywhere in the world, with any cellular phone. How awesome does that sound. 5G coverage while at sea, in a plane, in the middle of the andes. Anywhere you could think, boom connection. Now their stock is up a ton recently for only having launched 5 satellites. 



Once again cellular coverage can be a complicated concept for some, so here it is simply put. As of now, with whoever your cellar provider is, (AT&T, Verizon, TMobile) Im sure you lose coverage while driving in the middle of nowhere, on flights, and sometimes in populated areas you would never expect. And it’s only when you need connection that you realize you have no connection. So ASTS would fully eliminate this problem for anyone in the WORLD that owns a cellular phone and is connected with ASTS. The cellular market value sits at around 450 billion dollars. That’s 450,000,000,000. Nearly completely devastated if ASTS can do what it says. 



That being said, them being able to provide coverage anywhere in the world is a long shot. But that’s why I love it. They have already received FCC permission to complete the launch of 5 satellite which turned out successful. With their hefty goal in mind that would take over an entire sector, they have a bright road ahead of them all mapped out, just waiting for asphalt. 



So, why is ASTS the future?



1: They can provide cellular coverage ANYWHERE in the world from ANY cellular phone. And we already know how reliant our world is on electronics

2: They have successfully launched 5 satellites and in the works of creating their arsenal in space

3: If they are successful, they would take over a nearly 450 billion dollar sector and own a monopoly on cellular coverage. 

4: they have strong investors including they major partner AT&T, Google, Vodafone, and more







So anyways, that’s just my two sense of stocks I see making people fortunes. But I’m just a teenager with no degree in quantum computing, nuclear fusion, or cellular communications so take it with a grain of salt.

"Vans, Off The Wall $VFC",1730021578.0,143,1gd78yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gd78yi/vans_off_the_wall_vfc/,104,"I'm here to talk about a speculative bet on $VFC the parent company of Vans, The North Face, Timberlands, Dickies etc.

Some of you might have remembered my Turnaround DD i've posted 6 months ago. The stock has since then came off the low of $12.00 and has hit 52 week highs of $21.50 essentially doubling in price. As of today, the stock price has retraced back to $16.50 forming a Inverted Heads and Shoulders pattern and i've got a trade set-up prior to earnings which is on Monday after close. There will also be an Investor Day coming Wednesday.

# The Thesis

I anticipate CEO Bracken Darrell to resinstate revenue and earnings guidance which he withdrew exactly one year ago. I'm confident this will for reasons as follows. A whole year went by where there weren't any concrete forward-looking statements (e.g. Supreme sale wasn't announced until it was confirmed, revamp of management wasn't announced until it happened etc). He has been particularly secretive about the positive developments of the company. With that, he has implicitly built hype around VFC's Investor Day event as evidenced in the excerpts below from his last earnings call.

>...and consistent with that, when we talk about our guidance or lack of guidance when we get to October, we'll come up with a formula for how we're going to do this. I don't want to spoil the fun now. We kind of have a game plan. But we will give you more than we've given you in the past, and we'll certainly give you something more in the intermediate term, something that you can look to and see where we're really trying to head to. So without saying any more, because Allegra will elbow me right in the neck because she's that close. I'll stop there.

>...we spent the last four months really scoping additional cost savings. We're not ready to surface with anything yet. But we will talk about that in October. We're actually working with an external consultant on that, and we feel really good about our program.

>...in terms of the turn – the Vans turn and the turn in general on the business, when do I forecast it happening? I'm not going to give you a number today, but I will tell you in October, we'll be ready to talk about that. So I feel very good about the progress we're making. It feels very similar to where I was when I was in my last company, and I feel like I can see it, and I feel good about it.

If he reinstates revenue/earnings guidance to the upside we could bounce +30% over a month as this stock has been a known underweight. If you asssess them by their financial numbers (of which are horrendous, declining revenues, high debt/EBITDA ratios, lower gross margins compared to peers). Not many have time to look into the details and read between the lines like I do.

Other than the implicit hint above, I also have acquired sufficient evidence there is enough catalysts ahead for him to bring back guidance to the upside. Below is a compilation of it :

* Vans has spent the past year cleaning its inventory channels and pulling out of discount stores— a process they completed as of June '24. According to the CEO, they now have eight months of predictable sales and demand. This means no more bloated inventory issues and a significant reduction in low-margin fire sales.
* Vans has an extensive product line : UltraRange, MTE, Classics, KNU skool, Skate and BMX, Lowlands, Uplands, Mary Jane, Premium, OTW. Of which KNU SKOOL and one of their biggest mistakes before was overdoing the Vans classics e.g. old skools, sk8-his, slip-ons etc. That will change. For example, Vans has been pushing their MTE (Made for The Elements) range as weather gets colder, which is literally your Classics but multi-terrain. On franchise management of each product line, CEO said this : ""You're going to see us take the gas out of some of the older styles for a while and then re-goose starting from the top of the culture chain with key influencers and then flow them down. This is franchise management 101 plus innovation, which I think is really the model for growing a footwear brand.""
* Vans brings back the Warped Tour for 2025. THIS IS HUGE as everyone would be banging their heads with chequered slip-ons. This is a huge refresh cycle for the punk rockers. That is exactly when Vans re-goose the Classics !
* New Brand President of Vans is ex-CPO from Lululemon (2017-2024). She played a monumental in Lululemon's success, Lulu's first footwear product was lead by her, and have no doubt she will be releasing new products in early '26.
* KNU Skool has become their #2 product line. On Footlocker's Earnings Call Update, they've said this : ""We're seeing encouraging trends out of the Vans brand, especially through their KNU school franchise. Next to that, we are excited for a strong boot season with Timberland this fall and holiday (another brand of $VFC)""

I'll save the positive developments of Timberlands and Dickies for next time. Besides Vans, I also anticipate Bracken to announce one or two more brand sales other than Supreme to reach their target optimal balance of debt/ equity.

The current implied move after Investor Day is 12%, which is on par with the likes of $COIN $SOFI $RDDT. That's pretty wild for an apparel company. My price target remains at $30.00 by end of year.

Regardless of where this moves, I'll be forever grateful for all the joy Vans have given me growing up. I will always love the brand and what it stands for - always being authentic to yourself.

Trading is a journey filled with **wins and losses**—it’s all part of the game. Someone recently asked me how I protect my capital on the downside, and if my **“directional gambling addiction”** always pays off. Well, let’s be honest: If there were a secure, foolproof way to bet on the market, we wouldn’t be sitting here doing this, right? I'd probably be **hiking somewhere in Wengen or Interlaken, Switzerland**, enjoying the view.

For those of you who don’t know me, let me introduce myself briefly. I’m **not a financial advisor**—far from it. I’m a **brain tumor survivor**, and trading equities has become both my **passion and hobby**. Any gains I make, I donate to my **non-profit organization**.

Now, let’s dive into my next analysis on the upcoming **META earnings report**. Will this be the moment where **Zuckerberg-a-ta** grins with joy—or not? Here's my take.

# Trend and Channel Analysis:

* **Ascending Channel**: META is currently trading within a well-defined **upward channel**, indicating a strong **bullish trend** over the past few months. The stock has been consistently making **higher highs and higher lows**.
   * **Upper resistance**: Around **$600–605** (near the top of the channel). The stock recently hit **$602.95** before pulling back slightly.
   * **Lower support**: The lower boundary of the channel is currently near **$540–550**. This suggests that if the stock sees any pullback, it could find support at those levels.

# Moving Averages:

* **8-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Currently at **$581.16**, META's price is slightly below this level at **$573.25**. This suggests the short-term trend might have weakened temporarily, but not broken.
* **21-day EMA**: This moving average provides stronger support around **$573.29**. The price is **hovering close to this EMA**, meaning that a rebound from here would signal continued bullish momentum.
* **200-day SMA**: Sitting at **$496.64**, far below the current price, indicating that META is well above its long-term support and remains in a **strong uptrend**.

# Stochastic RSI (Momentum Indicator):

* **Current level**: 23.79, which indicates **oversold conditions**. This suggests that the stock might be near a **reversal point**, with potential for an upward bounce if buyers step in soon. However, it’s not yet confirmed, so the next few days will be crucial.

# MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):

* The **MACD line** is still above the **signal line**, but the histogram shows signs of weakening momentum (declining green bars). This could indicate that bullish momentum is slowing, and there may be a period of **consolidation** or minor pullback unless strong earnings or catalysts boost the stock.

# Key Levels to Watch:

* **Support**:
   * Short-term: $570 (near the 21-day EMA).
   * Lower support: $540–550 (bottom of the channel).
* **Resistance**:
   * Immediate resistance: $600–605 (recent high).
   * If META breaks above $605, it could lead to a strong **breakout** with the next target in the **$620+** range.

With earnings coming soon, the stock is likely to experience **volatility**. Given the current position within the ascending channel, the **risk/reward** looks balanced. A move above **$600** on positive earnings could extend the rally, but any disappointment might lead to a pullback to the **$550** level.

2) Vans has an extensive product line : UltraRange, MTE, Classics, KNU skool, Skate and BMX, Lowlands, Uplands, Mary Jane, Premium, OTW Of which KNU SKOOL and one of their biggest mistakes before was overdoing the Vans classics e.g. old skools, sk8-his, slip-ons etc. That will change. For example, Vans has been pushing their MTE (Made for The Elements)  range as weather gets colder, which is literally your Classics but multi-terrain.  
  
On franchise management of each product line , Bracken said this  :   
\> ""You're going to see us take the gas out of some of the older styles for a while and then re-goose starting from the top of the culture chain with key influencers and then flow them down. This is franchise management 101 plus innovation, which I think is really the model for growing a footwear brand.""  
  
3) Vans brings back the Warped Tour for 2025. THIS IS HUGE as everyone would be banging their heads with chequered slip-ons. This is a huge refresh cycle for the punk rockers. That is exactly when Vans re-goose the Classics !

4) New Brand President of Vans is ex-CPO from Lululemon (2017-2024). She played a monumental in Lululemon's success, Lulu's first footwear product was lead by her, and have no doubt she will be releasing new products in early '26.

5) KNU Skool has become their #2 product line. On Footlocker's Earnings Call Update, they've said this :  
""We're seeing encouraging trends out of the Vans brand, especially through their KNU school franchise. Next to that, we are excited for a strong boot season with Timberland this fall and holiday (another brand of $VFC)""

I'll save the positive developments of Timberlands and Dickies for next time. Besides Vans, I also anticipate Bracken to announce one or two more brand sales other than Supreme to reach their target optimal balance of debt/ equity.   
  
The current implied move after Investor Day is 12%, which is on par with the likes of $COIN $SOFI $RDDT. That's pretty wild for an apparel company. My price target remains at $30.00 by end of year  
  
Regardless of where this moves, I'll be forever grateful for all the joy Vans have given me growing up.  I love the brand more than I love the stock <3.

Quick Stock Memo: Long GRND,1729980066.0,11,1gcw29g,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gcw29g/quick_stock_memo_long_grnd/,4,"**Analyst / Author Background:** Hi, this is my first ever post on Reddit / WSB. Pleasure to meet everyone. For background on myself, I'm a 35 year old male, worked in investment banking for one year and have been working in private equity for the last \~15 years (middle market buyouts, growth equity, etc.). I am straight, however a close friend of mine who has been a user of GRND told me about the Company which led me to read up on the stock.

**Revenue Model:** The Company primarily generates revenue through a freemium subscription model as well as targeted advertising.

**Business / Product Overview:** GRND is a two-sided marketplace mobile app that provides social networking / social media solutions on a global basis to the LGBTQ community. Users primarily use the app for dating, or more so ""casual encounters"". Other than having a similar revenue model, GRND is fundamentally a different business from all other dating apps in that its users regularly use the app to find sexual partners. 

**Product / Service:** Users on average are on the app for 60+ minutes per day, compared to \~10 minutes for Tinder and other dating apps. On average, GRND users spend 7-10 hours per month on the app. This significant difference in engagement highlights how the GRND product is different from all other dating apps, and therefore a ""stickier"" solution (price inelasticity of males looking for sex) and a more loyal userbase (GRND is already the de factor gay app and due to its scale, there is no reason for new LGBT individuals do go on any other app due to the number of users - this is the beauty of a two-sided marketplace at scale). Also, the velocity of engagement is reoccurring - while other dating apps have embedded user churn (built to delete the app), gay men use the app with velocity, on a repeat basis, and rarely delete the app.

**Capitalization / Ownership:** The Company has \~3x EBITDA total debt, which is prudent for this type of business. The Company was previously Chinese-owned, IPOd via SPAC, and subsequently acquired by a small consortium led by George Raymond Zage III, a former hedge fund manager, who now privately owns \~45% of the Company. Balance is owned by individuals, employees, hedge funds / asset managers, etc.

**Financials:** The Company is expecting $332M Revenue with $141M EBITDA for FYE 12-24. The Company has grown top-line Revenue more than 30% YoY for the last 5+ years and Gross Margin steadily increasing from 70% in 2020 to 74% in 2024E. 

**Market Segmentation:** The LGBTQ segment of the market is the fastest growing segment of the population. Serves the LGBTQ market, which as a portion of the total population has doubled in the last decade. In 2023, 9.8% of Millennials identified at LGBTQ, while 22.3% of Gen Z identify at LGBTQ. With each younger generation, a larger mix of the population identifies as LGBTQ- as these cohorts graduate high school, college etc., this will rapidly accelerate GRND's already rapid user growth. I imagine their CAC / LTV is attractive and getting even better as they scale (all growth word of mouth).  

**Valuation:** Currently trading at \~7x 2024E Revenue and \~18x 2024E EBITDA.

**Competition / Misunderstood Asset:** GRND has zero viable competition. GRND is incorrectly categorized as a dating app. Why should GRND not be viewed as a participant in the highly competitive / saturated and commoditized dating app market? The user engagement (GRND is 6x compared to any other dating app) tells us that it is a different service being offered than that of Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, etc. The value prop of GRND is sex, which gays care about, and there is no other app with the scale / number of men as GRND. The business should be looked at as part (1) two-sided marketplace (uber/lyft, etc.), (2) part dating app, and (3) part social media site (FB/Meta). The rest of the dating app landscape is purely swipe left/right commoditized tech and many offerings in the market therefore no pricing power.

**Quick Model:** Assuming consistent but decelerating growth over the next five years (22.5% YoY), current leverage (3x), margin trend in line with historical, same O/S shares, etc. gets you a 5-year stock price target of $34 dollars/share, 165% upside from current level and \~22% annual IRR. This is a conservative case given market trends, accelerating growth, competitive dynamics, etc. Also, I'm sure if you did a run-off DCF with what I believe to be very good retention metrics for this business, a DCF would indicate it is materially undervalued.

**Summary / Thesis:** For gays looking for casual encounters / sex, not only is GRND the best place to go, it is the only place to go. GRND has no alternatives, whereas the swipe left/right dating tech is antiquated / a commodity / no barriers. GRND's value proposition is sex (gays are more open/less traditional), whereas tinder/bumble/match/hinge's value proposition is a drinks/dinner date. We will see accelerated growth in the coming years as the total LGBTQ population rapidly expands driving an acceleration of user growth, powering continued strength of value proposition (more men to choose from) coupled with a significant lack of viable alternatives (gay social media app at scale / with millions of users). The market / Wall Street Analysts have been slow to appreciate the asset (dating apps are a troubled, commoditized category, and it was a neglected security because it is the offspring of a SPAC). Wall Street Analysts over the next year or two are likely to initiate coverage of the stock (only two large banks cover it currently). 

NOTE: I wrote this up in \~20min, so please forgive any typos, etc. Let me know any questions.

I Like LLY – Is Now the Time to Be Bullish?,1729996829.0,0,1gd1af0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gd1af0/i_like_lly_is_now_the_time_to_be_bullish/,28,"LLY has long been one of my favorite tickers. It carried us out of the trenches back during the tough days of the **yen carry trade unwind in August**. But the question now is: **Should we stay optimistic this time around?**

We’ve been stuck in **consolidation territory** for quite some time, and the sideways movement has left many waiting for the next big move. Personally, I remain **bullish**—there’s been plenty of build-up, and it seems ready to break out.

Now, let’s talk potential: **What happens if LLY reaches $1,000 per share?**

With approximately **900.9 million shares outstanding**, a price of **$1,000 per share** would push the company’s market cap to **around $991 billion**. That would put Eli Lilly on the brink of **trillion-dollar territory**, elevating it to the elite ranks among global giants.

# Trend and Price Action

* **Ascending Channel**: LLY is trading within a well-established **uptrend channel**, marked by the two white trendlines. The stock is currently **near the lower end of the channel**, which could act as **support** around **$870-$880**. If the price holds here, it could bounce back toward the **mid-$900s**.
* **Sideways Consolidation Zone (Gray Area)**: The stock has been consolidating between **$880 and $970** for several weeks, forming a **range-bound pattern**. This reflects **indecision** among traders, meaning the market is waiting for a catalyst, such as the upcoming earnings report, to break out of this range.

# Technical Indicators

1. **Stochastic RSI**:
   * Currently in **oversold territory** near **4.29**, indicating the stock might be **due for a bounce**. This suggests that if earnings beat expectations, there’s a good chance the stock could rally back toward the **$950+ range**.
2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   * The **MACD line is below the signal line**, with the histogram slightly negative, indicating **weak momentum**. However, the MACD appears to be **flattening**, which often precedes a reversal. This adds to the possibility of a **bullish bounce** if earnings are favorable.

# Key Support and Resistance Levels

* **Support**:
   * **$870-$880** (lower boundary of the ascending channel)
   * **$820** (next major support if the lower channel breaks)
* **Resistance**:
   * **$915-920** (near current price action and 21-day EMA)
   * **$970** (upper end of the recent consolidation range)
   * **$1,000+** (psychological resistance if it breaks out post-earnings)

# Earnings Scenarios

1. **Bullish Scenario**:
   * If earnings exceed expectations and guidance is positive, expect the stock to break above **$915**, with a potential test of **$970-$1,000**.
   * The **uptrend channel** indicates that LLY has room to rally to **$1,000+**, aligning with bullish momentum.
2. **Bearish Scenario**:
   * If earnings disappoint or the market reacts poorly to guidance, the stock could break below **$870** and test support near **$820**.
   * If it falls out of the **ascending channel**, this could trigger further downside pressure, with the next key support around **$800**.

# Conclusion

The **current consolidation and oversold Stochastic RSI** suggest a potential rebound is likely if earnings deliver even slightly positive surprises. However, **earnings volatility** could push the price toward either **$970+** or down to **$820**, depending on the report and forward guidance.

This setup offers a **high-risk, high-reward opportunity**, and traders should monitor the **earnings release** closely to see which way the stock breaks out of its consolidation zone.

Why would a company cancel the shares as opposed to holding onto them as treasury shares?

  
My limited thinking would be that converting them to treasury shares would be better as: (1) the company would retain the ability to reissue them at a later date, (2) the company would limit outside ownership (e.g. prevent hostile takeover), and (3) the company would still retain the ability to always cancel the shares in the future.

Now you can fly an organ from Alaska to NYC and use it 24 hours later with better results than a donor organ on ice flown 3 hours away. Obviously the value proposition is huge - hospitals save money so transplant surgeons don’t need to be on call; healthcare workers love not having to wake up at 2am and rush to perform emergent surgery; taxpayers save money because a transplant is much cheaper than lifetime dialysis or organ failure care.

 Why did the stock go down? Because the company called out seasonality in organ transplants. 3Q is always softer in regards to organ transplant numbers. But the company RAISED 2024 revenue guidance in the last 2Q earnings. They’ve beat earnings estimates 11 times in a row. They just launched their own private jet service to deliver organs to hospitals and the government reimburses them at a profit. The stock is down 30% since 2Q earnings by “analysts” are scared they won’t beat earnings. They will beat earnings because they raised guidance after 2Q and simply pointed out 3Q is always a bit slow. 

I’m posting my call option positions but I also own a ton of stock for over a year now. Buy this dip. Bet your wife’s boyfriend’s money. It’s a winner next week. Oct 28 is earnings and Oct 29 call options will skyrocket. $145 and $165 call options 12/20."

UWMC DD and Unusual Options Activity,1729883275.0,17,1gc22l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gc22l1/uwmc_dd_and_unusual_options_activity/,33,"Alright, here's the lowdown on UWMC, a wholesale mortgage giant and one of America's largest with an 8% or so market share, which makes them a huge player in the wholesale mortgage game. They’re basically the middleman, partnering with brokers rather than going directly to customers. They’re fast and handle a crazy volume of loans. Their bread and butter is refinancing and new home loans, so the company’s health ties closely to what’s happening with interest rates and the housing market. They repackage said loans into MBS products and sell them to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae which took on 93% of their loans last year. Usually they have a minimum 30 day holding period, and then these mortgages are off their books for good. UWMC’s last earnings were solid. They reported a 17% revenue increase YoY. Keep in mind this is with interest rates being higher in Q2 this year than they were in Q2 last year. Their price per book ratio is around 6 and their price per cash flow ratio is 28, down from a whopping 185 a year ago. This steep drop means UWMC’s getting its cash flow game together, which makes it more attractive if they keep cash flowing like this. Rates will continue to cut, revenue continues to explode, it becomes a really good interest rate play, especially if Daddy JPow keeps lowering rates. I think this makes a fantastic stock play if you're looking for at least medium term growth, especially since it's trading at under 7 dollars, makes it a value play.

Top institutions are continuing to buy this stock as well, just take a look at some of these listings. 

* Citadel Advisors: 10.18 Million Shares
* Vanguard Group: 8.61 Million Shares
* Fidelity: 8.20 Million Shares
* Platinum Equity: 4.50 Million Shares
* BlackRock: 4.82 Million Shares
* Northern Trust: 4.35 Million Shares
* Renaissance Technologies: 1.71 Million Shares

I’m usually not one to think about who owns the company, but if Citadel owns about 1/7^(th) of the shares of your company’s open float in non-fund shares, it must mean they really fucking like you. But that’s not the main reason why I’m bringing this up. The total float is about 95 million shares, and 26 million of those shares are closely held. 26 million in closely held shares and 65 million in fund ownership really leave roughly 3-5 million shares left available for purchase. Hold on to this thought, I’ll come back to this later. 

During looking this over, I also took a look at their job listings. Everything looked normal  until I came across this [job listing](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/rpa-developer-iii-at-united-wholesale-mortgage-4034330446/) that’s looking at Robotics Process Automation Development. In short, they want to automate some tasks at the organization and improve efficiency. This lead to ask myself why would a mortgage underwriter go out and hire AI developers to automate tasks? I think the answer is pretty simple. The individual underwriters at this organization take a MASSIVE chunk out of variable costs because they are the ones doing the work. What if the automation is for them to underwrite the mortgages themselves? If they can achieve this in totality, it would cut out over 20% of their expenses, and insane amount, not even counting the general and administrative costs they have to cover as well. My guess is that they are going to announce something with regards to AI and Automation of tasks at the next earnings meeting, and we all know how much Wall Street loves AI.

This is where things get fucking crazy. I wanted to buy options and I started looking at their volume and open interest. I started cataloging the Total Options Volume and Open Interest which is over 170,000. A MASSIVE, MASSIVE amount for a company of this size. Ok, but what if a lot of them are put options trying to sell it off? Nope. **The P/CR is at 0.20 or lower. A P/CR this low means there are way more calls than puts.** It’s a sign that these people are heavy, heavy, on the bull side. The other part is the distribution upon which these calls are bought. Before new expiration dates were added and new strikes, the heaviest were concentrated around the 8, 9, and 10 dollar strikes for November 15^(th), the week after their earnings report. This past week they added strikes for the week of their ER, but there hasn’t been any volume or OI at these strikes on this expiration. The next concertation of open interest and volume is actually for January/February of next year. And the funny part is they aren’t arbitrary amounts like 736 or 643 or something like that. **These buys are done in hundreds or thousands of contracts to a rounded amount. Today alone, 7,500+ contracts were bought TODAY at the 7c for 12/20 of this year. 15,000+ were bought TODAY for 8c, 11/15 the week after ER.**  

If we were dealing with NVDA or MSFT or some other company, it probably would be some run of the mill type thing. But this is a company with 3 million shares left on the float. If UWMC reports strong earnings and we see a rate cut, People will buy up UWMC and those call options will go in-the-money, and there won’t be any more shares left for purchase. Stock will likely go through the ROOF.  think the hedges are planning something big on this one.

 UWMC has a decent short interest with 14.8 million shares shorted with 6.7 days to cover. This is relatively high. If there’s a squeeze, which is possible because of the gamma spike, the price might go to the moon. 



My positions so far:

11/15 8c 40

11/15 9c 30

11/15 10c 75

And I’m buying more.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
 

TLDR: Buy UWMC, it's gonna moon

TSLA shares add billions to Elon Musk's net worth,1729873726.0,22,1gbydry,https://i.redd.it/luej8p3qixwd1.jpeg,143,"Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.

On Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.

Much of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.

He predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from “fully unsupervised” Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his “best guess” for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.

In an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, “I predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.”

Musk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).

Tesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.

The second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.

Tesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year."

Someone explain why I shouldn’t go all in on puts against them and low-level development companies like Appian. Because to me, they seems like the next Chegg.

For context, I’ve already purchased some deep OTM puts a year or so out on Fiverr, Appian, and a couple consulting companies.

It can put it into action, your average consumer doesn’t need to know how to do that anymore. Now picture this in 6 months to a year, given how much we’ve moved forward in that same time period. 

TL;DR: Fiverr, Appian, SaaS companies are going to lose revenue.

I’m looking for some guidance from experienced investors on hedging strategies. I’ve been fortunate to see good gains with my investment in NVIDIA, but with the market’s recent volatility, I’m considering ways to protect those gains through hedging.

Here’s my situation: My entire position is in NVIDIA, which has been highly correlated with the NASDAQ’s movements. I’ve read that inverse ETFs, especially leveraged ones like SQQQ, can be effective in offsetting downturns in the NASDAQ. However, I’m not entirely sure how to use them in a capital-efficient way while avoiding potential pitfalls with inverse and leveraged ETFs.

I’d appreciate advice on:

1. Calculating the appropriate amount of an inverse ETF to buy relative to my NVIDIA position.
2. Using leveraged inverse ETFs as a short-term hedge without exposing myself to excessive risks.
3. Any alternative hedging strategies that might suit my situation better, especially since I’m based in the EU and not all ETFs are available on DEGIRO.

Any insights or recommendations would be hugely appreciated! I want to make smart moves to safeguard my gains, so thanks in advance for any guidance you can share."

\- **Adam Goldstein is up to something**: he was away in LAS VEGAS when the FAA announced the SFAR, replaced by his FAA specialist, Captain Billy Nolen. He will also be absent in RIYADH during the FII 8th Edition 2024, replaced by his CCO Nikhil Goel who will intervene on October 30. [https://fii-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FII8-MASTER-PAG\_10.24.2024.pdf](https://fii-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FII8-MASTER-PAG_10.24.2024.pdf)  Adam Goldstein seems very focused on his November 7 earnings conference call. He usually reserves his announcements for this event, and prepares well.

\- **Stellantis is doing much better**: it was announced that its problems in the US market were resolved as expected before Christmas with an increase in RAM sales. If Stellantis experiences an uptrend, ACHR should benefit.

\- **Present at the OSAKA World Expo**: this has not yet been announced by ACHR but the Japanese press is talking about it. What is interesting is that it is NIKKO, which owns 10 million shares, which is behind the deal. A partnership between ACHR and Japan Airlines is planned to provide flight demonstrations during the exhibition. Why hasn’t ACHR talked about it yet? probably because the partnership that is brewing seems more important than just flying ACHR at the show. [https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/expo2025/20240926-OYO1T50059/](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/expo2025/20240926-OYO1T50059/)[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC2696R0W4A920C2000000/](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC2696R0W4A920C2000000/)

\- **Technical analysis clearly shows that the price will not go any lower**: the price seems to be deliberately maintained between $3 and $3.30. Daily observation shows that the price is manipulated so that the stock does not rise too quickly or too early. We can clearly see that the bull run will take place when the market makers decide. Some want to take their time to buy, others to hedge. Hence the formation of a “rounding bottom”. 

\- **ACHR has enough money for 6 quarters or a year and a half:** by then, the aircraft will be certified and production will have started. ACHR will of course need money but will be able to borrow very easily because its planes will be on the market, greatly reducing the risks of dilution. This is a huge advantage at this stage when we see Llium plummeting because it cannot raise funds.

\- **MIDNIGHT's design is copied by other competitors behind ACHR:** why is it good? This shows that the aircraft design is not something too original that would fail because it is too original. On the contrary, other engineers from other companies chose the same design. (Hyundai, Airbus, Wisk Aero...)

\- **Airlines have invested in ACHR and have significant orders:** who better than the airlines to judge the commercial viability of the airspace? It's 2024, you can drive a car in urban and extra-urban areas, you can fly in extra-urban airspace, but you can't move in urban airspace. Only because the helicopters are too noisy. (United Airline, Southwest Ailine, Indigo, Kakao mobility)

\- **ACHR has partnerships on all continents but above all, thanks to Stellantis, they will be able to access the European market very easily:** Stellantis has very important historical brands like Peugeot and Citroën for France, Fiat for Italy... It is politically impossible to prevent Stellantis from accessing the European Union. We all know that the European Union is very tough in terms of regulations. ACHR will compete at the same level as Airbus.

\- **The growth in the number of vertiports is exponential:** some vertiports are already under construction and development, sometimes even in international airports. A study predicts 1,044 operational vertiports in 2028. [https://www.unmannedairspace.info/uncategorized/the-world-is-planning-1044-vertiports-for-construction-by-2024-our-latest-report/](https://www.unmannedairspace.info/uncategorized/the-world-is-planning-1044-vertiports-for-construction-by-2024-our-latest-report/)

\- **Psychological analysis:** some individual investors are still in the capitulation, disbelief, anger, depression phase. While we are in reality in the Stealth Phase (Smart Money) or the Awareness Phase (Institutional investor).

\- **Market capitalization:** this could be a long debate, but in reality, looking at the current capitalization of 1 billion, nothing prevents ACHR from very soon being at 2 or 3 or 4 billion very easily. This well before final certification.

\- **The analysts' price target is significantly high at $9.08:** the lowest target is 50% higher than the current price. Other targets are 300% of the current price.

**-** **Georgia manufacturing plant is nearing completion:** this plant will be able to produce 650 aircraft per year and is designed to be able to increase its capacity. The announcement of completion will be a positive catalyst. In addition, it is certain that in a second phase, ACHR will open other factories around the world, probably with the help of Stellantis which is an international company. It's a long way off, but the announcement could be made soon.

\- **“Powered-lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years, and this historic rule will pave the way for accommodating wide-scale Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations in the future,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement :** even the FAA is ahead of schedule. In fact, it had until December to publish this certification. The FAA is bullish for the sector. Adam Goldstein, founder and CEO of Archer said, “We applaud the FAA on the release of the SFAR ahead of schedule as it represents a tremendous milestone for our country and the eVTOL industry. Now, Archer has a clear roadmap to pioneer eVTOL here in the U.S. Our team is full speed ahead in our ongoing partnership with the FAA as we work towards commercialization as soon as possible.”

**ACHR is definitely in a phase where everything can only get better. The current price and upcoming catalysts make it a great entry point. Price movements suggest that the first good news will have a powerful impact on the price. Imagine then that the good news followed one another and that ACHR had everything planned.**

While many know MicroStrategy as a “Bitcoin play,” its core software business—offering data analysis and visualization tools to large corporations—provides a stable revenue stream and robust operational foundation.

With Q4 earnings set to be reported on October 30, expectations are high. Analysts forecast an EPS of around $0.51, and investors are keen to see how Bitcoin’s recent price trends impact the company’s balance sheet. In Q2, EPS came in at -$0.57, reflecting Bitcoin’s volatility and its effect on MicroStrategy’s book value ￼ ￼.

MicroStrategy also holds a unique position as one of the market’s most shorted stocks, creating potential for a “short squeeze” if earnings or Bitcoin performance exceed expectations. This setup could attract investors who see an opportunity, as even modest gains in Bitcoin or software sales could trigger significant share price movement."

The also supply NASA, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Blue Origin and many more.

* They are currently working with $LLY on 3D bio-printing organs in space, which they’re making great progress of.
* They acquired Hera systems to increase the dominance for national security space customers.
* They were selected to provide advanced RF payloads to a leading defense contractor.
* They have joined the US-U.A.E council where Danny Sebright stated “Redwire’s pioneering advancements in Space Infrastructure showcase the very best of American innovation and ingenuity. As a member Redwire joins an elite list of member companies at the forefront of almost every industry.
* They signed a MOU with NASA’s REMIS-2 mission to provide Spaceflight hardware, ground hardware and software, engineering services, payload facility integration and more.
* Selected to provide a critical onboard computer system for the European Space Agency Hera Mission, Europes flagship planetary defense mission.
* To supply Solar Arrays for Thales Alenia Telecommunications product line.
* Selected by (SCA) to develop, build and deliver advanced thruster technology nicknamed the (Valkyrie Thurster) designed for reliable, high-volume production for the surge in national security space programmes.
* Awarded Darpa Prime Contract to be the prime mission integrator for the development of revolutionary air-breathing satellite that will demonstrate the use of Novel electric propulsion in very-low earth orbit (VLEO).
* Awarded Contract by the European Space agency to develop a Robotic Arm to support the landing for the International Lunar Exploration Mission.
* Selected by Rocketlab to provide Antennas and RF hardware.

And those are just some of the latest contracts & advancements Redwire has made. They’ve been prolific aquirers since going public and continue to aggressively expand their footprint across all space sectors.

It’s why their CEO goes by the Moto of “If space wins Redwire wins”, a confident statement backed by their foundational success of becoming the “building blocks to space”

Yet it’s currently one of the cheapest and most undervalued Space stocks there is. Trading at a P/S of just 1.58 compared to Rocket Labs 11.5. A market cap of just $450m vs Rocketlabs $4.28b & ASTS $6.73b

This isn’t about who’s better, it’s about Redwire being drastically undervalued and under the radar of most growth investors.

I shared my thoughts on Rocketlab 3-4 months ago after scooping the October and January calls.

Since then people have finally started to realise the potential in the company. To sit are similar valuations based upon growth and income, Redwire would not to hit approximately $42/share. At this point it would still remain once of the cheapest yet most advanced space companies out there.

Why now?

Stocks move in themes, every success trader from here to Timbuktu will tell you that. It’s caused by the excitement and willingness of investors to take on risk on what they believe to be innovative and early stage Giants. The recent news of SpaceX, the parabolic run in ASTS and Rocketlabs 50th successful launch, all set the stage for a new theme and fomo rally to emerge.

Just like when EVs moved thanks to the hype in Tesla we saw the entire sector move.

Just like when $AI started the AI run and others such as NVDA (plus plenty of others) took the button and ran for 12-18 months.

I see the Space sector as an emerging theme and names such as Redwire could potentially take the baton and garner worldwide interest.

For me, I see the worst case, bear case, as Redwire being a $1bn+ market cap by Christmas, which still represents a 100% move. Best case I see buyers stepping into calls of which market makers are drastically under-positioned for, creating a substantial over the top rally.

Please note: I haven’t a fucking clue what I’m talking about and none of this is advice.

Rising Optimism: U.S. Consumer Sentiment Boosted by Income Hopes and Lower Rates,1729868671.0,4,1gbwelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gbwelz/rising_optimism_us_consumer_sentiment_boosted_by/,7,"U.S. consumer sentiment rose in October to a six-month high as households grew more positive about buying conditions, supported by slightly lower financing costs.

According to the University of Michigan, the final October sentiment index increased to 70.5 from 70.1 in September, and up from a preliminary reading of 68.9.

https://preview.redd.it/07zfw18n3xwd1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a92b7317a3104a6ae70072fac30cd7e61e30c08

This marks the third month of rising sentiment, now reaching its highest level since April 2024 and over 40% above its low in June 2022. October's uptick is largely driven by better buying conditions for durable goods, supported by easing interest rates. The approaching presidential election is also shaping consumer expectations.

Additionally, income expectations rose to their highest since June, with respondents feeling more optimistic about the job market. However, lower-income consumers remain less confident about income growth compared to higher earners. Fewer consumers mentioned high interest rates as a negative factor for purchasing homes, durable goods, or vehicles.

Political views also influenced sentiment. Republican and independent voter confidence rose to its highest since April, while sentiment among Democrats dipped slightly.

**How about Inflation?**

Consumers expect inflation to rise at an annual rate of 2.7% over the next year, unchanged from the previous month. For the next five to ten years, they anticipate a 3% rate, down from 3.1%.

The University of Michigan's measure of durable goods buying conditions climbed to a four-month high, with more than half of consumers expecting further rate relief within the year, suggesting consumer spending will stay resilient and support the economy."

As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. 

1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).
2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.
3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. 

Keeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. 

On the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. 

On the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. 

Seems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. 

Now guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? 

*15 fucking times*. 

You heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! 

All of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. 

This is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. 

Positions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th.

The Hidden Truths About Trading Nobody Tells You: 4 Counter-Intuitive Facts,1729874828.0,0,1gbyto6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gbyto6/the_hidden_truths_about_trading_nobody_tells_you/,47,"Ever notice how trading wisdom often feels backwards? After years in the markets and countless conversations with both successful and struggling traders, I've discovered some surprising truths that challenge conventional wisdom. Let me share what really works in the trenches – not what you'll hear in flashy trading seminars.

# 1. Your First Entry Is (Almost) Irrelevant

Here's something that might shock you: your initial trade entry matters far less than you think.

The market is like a wild river – unpredictable and powerful. Even the most seasoned traders rarely nail their first entry. Whether you go long or short, the market often moves against you before going your way. Instead of seeking the perfect entry, embrace this reality:

* Start with small positions
* Celebrate when your first entry works (it's rare!)
* Add to your position only when the trend confirms your direction
* Never add to a position against the trend

Remember: Your biggest positions should come from building on correct trend reads, not from your initial entry.

# 2. Small Positions = Big Profits (Yes, Really!)

""Go big or go home"" is probably the worst advice in trading. Here's why:

Trading isn't physics. Doubling your position size doesn't simply double your profits – it can exponentially increase your risk of ruin. The real secret? Small positions are often your ticket to significant profits.

Think about it:

* Small positions let you stay in the game longer
* They give you emotional space to think clearly
* They prevent account-destroying losses
* When a real opportunity comes, you'll still have capital to trade

The traders who survive long enough to catch the big moves aren't the ones who bet big – they're the ones who stayed small and smart.

# 3. Your Best Friend? The Stop Loss

Everyone knows ""the trend is your friend,"" but let me introduce you to a better friend: the stop loss.

Picture your stop loss as a firefighter, not an enemy. It's not there to take your money – it's there to save your trading account from burning down. When markets are ranging (which is most of the time) or when you're wrong (which happens to everyone), your stop loss is your lifeline.

Pro tip: Next time you get stopped out, don't curse the stop loss. Thank it for protecting you from what could have been a much bigger disaster.

# 4. The Uncomfortable Truth: Trading Is a Tough Business

Let's be real: those Instagram traders posting from exotic beaches aren't telling you the whole story. Trading is actually one of the hardest ways to make money. Here's what they don't show you:

* Your win rate might hover around 50% (or lower when emotions kick in)
* Success requires robot-like discipline and emotional control
* Building a sustainable account takes time, patience, and countless small decisions
* The process can be lonely, boring, and psychologically challenging

Why do people still trade? Often, they're chasing the dream of easy money and freedom. But the real freedom in trading comes from accepting these harsh truths and working within them.

# The Bottom Line

Success in trading doesn't come from finding the perfect strategy or taking massive risks. It comes from embracing these counter-intuitive truths and building your approach around them. Start small, respect your stops, and remember: the path to consistent profits is often the opposite of what you'd expect.

The Edge in Calendar Spreads,1729817386.0,7,1gbi3wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gbi3wp/the_edge_in_calendar_spreads/,7,"I have recently looked into calender spreads and the strategy is pretty straight-forward you buy calls or puts with strike x and sell calls or puts with the same strike but different expiration. And when the stock is around strike x u get paid or else ur max loss is capped. But the thing that looked most interesting to me was the pricing mispricing of the options contracts. Im talking about the square root of time rule when pricing options. **if week 1 expiry options cost 2 dollars then week 4 expiry options with the same strike should cost sqaure root of 4 that is 2\*2 that is 4 dollars. 4 dollars should be the fair value. if it was 5 dollars then we could say its expensive or when its 3 dollars we could say its cheap.**

For Example, if we were to setup a calender spread on appl using this mispricing theory currently the nov 8 atm call is trading at 6.20 but the nov 22nd atm option is trading at 7.60 but the fair value using the square root of time it should be 8.77 dollars.would it be a profitable trade to buy the cheaper longer dated calls and short the near term calls ? **i have no clue about the direction weather it will go up down or sideways all i want to do is make money when cheaper one gets to fair value. i could just buy the cheap one only but that will be expensive and put me on a long risk instead by selling the shorter term i want to offset the cost and benefit from time decay**.

Any thoughts on this? Any input from anybody that tried it wil be greatly appreaciated!

* **DXCM**: DexCom, Inc. is a company that develops, manufactures, and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes management (source: Google). When you look around and compare people today with 10 years ago, don’t you notice how fucking fat everyone is today? A salad costs more than a cheeseburger, these days, I see people wearing glucose monitoring patches like they’re a fashion statement. Diabetes is booming, so expect green dildos today.
* **DECK**: Now, the people who actually work out and don’t have diabetes, I keep seeing them running outside wearing HOKA. A couple of years ago, if you asked me if I knew the brand, I would’ve said it’s some random aliexpress shoe, but now I see more and more people wearing HOKAs. I actually dig the design and colorways. But that’s not the **sole reason** (ba dum tss) I expect DECK to perform well today. Deckers doesn’t just own HOKA; they also own UGG — yes, those boots your mom wore in the early 2000s. Fast forward to 2024, and I see every girl at my college wearing them. All those snowflakes have been stocking up last quarter, so I expect UGG and HOKA will bring this stock to valhalla.
* **SKX:** Theyre dogshit (respectfully)

IMO, current Fair value is $10+.**

I've been diving into the world of eVTOLs lately, and I think Archer Aviation **($ACHR)** is a massively undervalued stock in an overvalued market. With yesterdays FAA approval paving the way for this new industry and some major catalysts on the horizon, I think we are at the moment of being not too early and not too late.

**A New Era in Air Transport**

Yesterday, the FAA released groundbreaking regulations approving a new category of air transport: powered-lift aircraft. This is the **first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years.** This historic rule will pave the way for EVTOLS to start operating, a market projected to be worth **$1.5 trillion by 2040**. This is a significant step towards revolutionizing urban transportation, logistics, and even emergency response services.

[The Future of Transportation](https://preview.redd.it/b8sjqgt6zowd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=971938b24d338e68769b9e1684ff48ef32bc245f)

**What Are eVTOLs?**

eVTOLs, or electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing aircraft, are a new type of air vehicles that offer a quieter (operating at about 45 dB), more cost-effective in build and operation(Can be 1/10 the cost of a helicopter), and cheap to supply with energy(10-50 minutes of charge in the current state of batteries) alternative to traditional helicopters. They are also easier and quicker to build than helicopters leading to scalability.

The leading companies in this space are:

* **Archer Aviation (ACHR)** valued at 1.15 Billion at $3.22
* **Joby Aviation (JOBY)** \- valued at 4.45 Billion at $6.20
* **Volocopter** \- a private German company valued at 1.87 Billion

**Archer Aviations Midnight**

Archer's flagship eVTOL aircraft, the **Midnight**, is designed to revolutionize urban air mobility, especially in congested metropolitan areas. Here's why it stands out:

* **Cost Efficiency**: Operating the Midnight can cost around **$500 per hour**, dramatically less than the **$10,000 per hour** it costs to operate traditional helicopters like the Blackhawk in disaster relief scenarios. This drastic reduction in operational costs comes from its electric propulsion system, which involves fewer mechanical parts and significantly lower maintenance needs. It make it a very affordable faster means of transportation/logistics.
* **Speed and Range**: Reaches speeds of up to **150 mph** with a range ideal for **20-50 mile** trips, turning hour-long commutes into minutes.
* **Quick Turnaround**: Equipped with a battery system that can **charge in minutes(10-40 depending on route) between flights**, allowing for rapid back-to-back operations.
* **Safety Features**:
   * **Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP)**: Uses **12 electric motors** and **12 propellers**, so if one fails, others compensate—no single point of failure.
   * **Redundancy**: Features **6 independent battery packs** for enhanced reliability.
* **Quiet Operation**: Operates at around **45 dBA** during forward flight, significantly quieter than traditional helicopters, reducing urban noise pollution.
* **Payload**: Can carry over **1,000 lbs**, suitable for both passenger transport and potential cargo operations.
* **Ease of Production**: Designed to be **easy and quick to build** for scalable manufacturing.
* **Efficiency in Development**: Archer completed its required 400 flight hours for testing significantly ahead of schedule(4 months).
* **Military Interest**: U.S. Air Force entered into contracts with Archer Aviation worth up to **$142 million** due to its advanced capabilities, aesthetic appeal, and potential applications in rapid response and logistics
* **Significant Backlog of Orders**: Archer has amassed a **backlog of orders worth nearly $6 billion**, highlighting strong market demand and confidence in the Midnight's potential.

**Upcoming Catalysts for ArcherOpening of the Covington, Georgia Factory**

1. **Upcoming Earnings Report (November 7, after market close)**
   * **Potential Highlights**:
      * **Funding Updates**: Possible announcements of new funding or partnerships.
      * **Operational Milestones**: They've completed over 400 test flights 4 months ahead of schedule. This indicates that they are laser focused on getting to the market asap with possible updated guidance and timelines.
      * **Market Expansion**: In the last month, the CEO went to Abu Dhabi and major announcement is rumored to be about their operation in Abu Dhabi next year as the first market. Moreover, they were in discussion in India for a possible operation over there.
      * **New Funding?**: With Archer beating deadlines, I'm optimistic for some type of funding being announced. I wish for an announcement of No offerings lol for certain period of time like AST did where the stock rose from $8 to $27 but I dont think this would happen here just wishful thinking.

**Financial Situation and Institutional Interest**

Archer Aviation's financial footing is solid, especially for a company pioneering a new industry:

* **Cash Reserves and Runway**:
   * As of Q2, **$590 million** with a quarterly cash outflow of about **$80-90 million**, they have an **18-month runway**.
* **Backlog of Orders**:
   * They have a massive **$6 billion** backlog for their Midnight aircraft, indicating strong future revenue potential.
* **Stellantis Partnership**:
   * Stellantis is contributing up to **$400 million** to help Archer ramp up production to 650 units annually. Stellantis will cover manufacturing labor costs and capital expenditures for initial production.
   * **Warrants Issued**: Archer has issued **$30 million** in performance warrants to Stellantis, which vest upon achieving certain milestones.
* **Military Contracts**:
   * **U.S. Air Force Deal**: Contracts worth up to **$142 million**, including the delivery of up to six Midnight aircraft and collaboration on pilot training and maintenance.
* **Institutional Ownership**: As of Q2, 21 hedge funds held positions in ACHR with around 31% institutional ownership.

**Leadership**

* Billy Nolen, Former acting FAA Administrator, was pouched from the FAA to act now as Archer's Chief Safety Officer. His main job is to speed certification ASAP.
* **CEO Adam Goldstein,** aka the Kendall Roy that Logan always wished for (doppelganger), is very active on social media with him making a video on Youtube after every Quarterly earnings explaining what happened in the quarter in details. I really respect this level of transparency as it shows how confident they are. They also actively invite YouTubers and media to tour their facilities and provide detailed updates on the manufacturing process and progress.

**Valuation Gap: Archer vs. Joby why archer should be At +$10**

* **Market Caps**:
   * **Archer (ACHR)**: \~$1.1 billion
   * **Joby Aviation (JOBY)**: \~$4.43 billion

While Joby is ahead in development and timelines (10-20% ahead) with recently receiving FAA authorization for a software platform, at its current valuation, ACHR is very undervalued. It has a **$6 billion** backlog of orders for their **Midnight** aircraft, Secured contracts worth up to **$142 million** with the U.S. Air Force and has strong partnerships with industry giants like **Stellantis** and **United Airlines.**

IMO, **current fair valuation for ACHR should be at least at +$10**(This post is already long can go into details if you like in a future post) and we would still not be at JOBYs current valuation

**Risks and Considerations**

Investing in emerging technologys such as eVTOLS is High Risk/ High reward:

* **Regulatory and Technological Risks**: Delays in FAA certification or unforeseen technical issues could disrupt progress.
* **Financial Risks**: This industry requires high capital which increases the risk of debt and dilution.
* **Operational Risks**: Manufacturing complexities or infrastructure challenges could delay production timelines.
* One bad incident in this industry could derail everything

**Final Thoughts**

ACHR provides a great entry point for this new industry as it's very undervalued (**Fair value +$10**) in my opinion. It's a long term High Risk(the type that might go to zero lol)/ Very High Reward play if everything pans out according to plan.

I'm not a financial advisor and this post isn't financial advice. This DD is very highly speculative and might contain mistakes. It's an opinion post and my opinion might be wrong lol. That being said, don't invest in this stock based on this DD and do your own research.

Their earnings are 11/2, 3 days before election. Berkshire has never seen volatility like it has recently and that will play a huge factor in is price action. The company's core assets reside in sectors such as insurance, energy, and consumer goods. Recently they sliced their holding of $AAPL in half, reducing their position to only 2.6% of the outstanding shares. Even  after concluding their sales $AAPL remains Berkshires largest holding at roughly 30% of their portfolio. Furthermore, their cash balance sits at a whopping $277 billion. This is my analysis of Berkshire Hathaway and why I think they will see upside heading towards election, what are your guys thoughts?"

The company posted a profit of $493 million, or $1.35 per share, compared to a loss of $700 million, or $2.17 per share, in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings were $1.78 per share, surpassing analyst expectations of $1.71 per share. Revenue increased by nearly 50% to $4.10 billion, slightly below the $4.12 billion expected by analysts.Cloud sales soared by 153% year-over-year, primarily due to higher nearline shipments to data center customers. This segment's performance underscores the robust demand for storage solutions driven by AI applications. While client sales saw a modest increase of 5%, consumer sales declined by 7%, indicating varying demand dynamics across different market segments.CEO David Goeckeler highlighted the strategic positioning of Western Digital's flash and HDD product portfolios to leverage opportunities arising from the AI data cycle. This suggests a strong focus on capitalizing on the growing data storage needs driven by AI advancements.For the current quarter, Western Digital projects revenue between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, with adjusted earnings per share ranging from $1.75 to $2.05. These projections are in line with, but slightly below, analyst expectations of $4.33 billion in revenue and $1.93 in adjusted earnings per share.Western Digital's impressive turnaround and strong cloud sales growth highlight its strategic alignment with the AI-driven demand for data storage. However, the mixed performance across different segments and slightly conservative outlook warrant close monitoring. Investors should consider the company's ability to sustain growth in the cloud segment and address challenges in the consumer market.TLDRWestern Digital (WDC) reported a strong turnaround in its fiscal first quarter, driven by a 153% surge in cloud sales due to AI demand.

I have been ALL IN on Tesla since Feb 2022 (had 571 shares). The ups and downs have been brutal and I am tired of watching my money go down after a big run up. Everyone says, don't time the market because it is impossible. Well, this time I gave in and I pulled out of the Tesla this morning after the big run it made this week. Now at an ATH it feels nice, but I am also terrified of Tesla going up further. I am a Tesla bull and believe the stock will be worth around $2,000 in the years to come. I also feel like the stock is currently at a local maximum. I am hoping that the stock drops so I can buy more tesla stock at a lower price and basically ""steal"" more shares. The weird thing about all of this is that you will never find a bigger Tesla bull then me, but at this very moment in time, I am actually hoping the stock drops so I can buy more shares. Has anyone else felt like this? It is a very awkward place to be. It is nice to lock in the profits, but terrifying to be ""off"" the tesla train at the moment."

bull gamma killed COST,1729799769.0,2,1gbbr5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gbbr5w/bull_gamma_killed_cost/,11,"Market sentiment for $COST has been positive with analysts raising price targets, attempted breakouts and news articles posting about Costco being the next Netflix breakout trend. Price is trending above 890 and a break of 900 would be great. 

That’s what’s on the surface. Taking a look at higher highs and lower lows. Costco has been making lower highs and every time it made lower highs it dumped huge in selling volume. Might be distribution who knows? But that’s not the point. It’s that there is huge volume at the top and recently selling picked up again.

Must be consolidation for a breakout higher right? Maybe…

However, a naughty naughty trader introduced some volatility into Costco this week. They thought they were smart and because Costco def can’t go under 870 they sold some put spreads for this week 20k contracts and next week 12k contracts. 0.13 spread and 0.33 spread. That nets $550k given that Costco doesn’t go below 870. But opening these contracts they introduced down side pressure. 

I welcome you down side pressure. I will take some nice ATM put. Thanks for blowing money in my direction. 


Ive also noticed that there was no upside hedging on the call side … this means the only hedging would be to sell the stock to hedge for the potential drop. Introducing more downside?

I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. I’m only sharing why I’m taking my trade.


TLDR someone wants to make bank on Costco put spreads because Costco has positive sentiment so they think it won’t go down.  But because they introduced this huge position they made it negative for the stock short term. It’s my chance to ride his wave."
Robinhood performance - Help understand its momentum,1729767575.0,12,1gazuqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gazuqq/robinhood_performance_help_understand_its_momentum/,10,"Hi all, you might have noticed the strong performance of Robinhood year to date (+111,70%).

It caught might attention and I started to look into their financial statements.

Despite a consistent revenue performance from 2021 till today:

2021. $ 1.815.000.000,00

2022. $ 1.360.000.000,00

2023. $ 1.870.000.000,00

Robinhood has a huge burden coming from Technology, Marketing and administration expenses, but it is decreasing over time:

|year|Sga expenses/revenue ratio|Tech expenses/revenue ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|

|2021|93,66%|67,99%|
|2022|75,51%|64,56%|
|2023|68,98%|43,05%|

Also their asset liabilities ratio is not so exciting:

|year|asset/liabilities ratio|liabilities|assets||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|2022|70,19%|$ 16.381.000.000,00|$ 23.337.000.000,00||

Given these figures, can you explain the Robinhood momentum? 

What am I missing out? Shall I look for something else in the financial statements?"
It is very clear to me that WSB goes full regard when it comes to TSLA.,1729724531.0,88,1gao0i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gao0i1/it_is_very_clear_to_me_that_wsb_goes_full_regard/,260,"Never go full regard. Stop letting your hate for musk cloud your already ill advised judgment. I’m mad because time and time again every time this dumb sub says to buy puts on TSLA, I do and I’ve finally learned my lesson.


These things are true:


1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.


2) FSD continues to improve and is postured better to scale than any of its competitors including wAyMo. FSD is transformational, a lot of you boneheads just refuse to admit it. FSD will be successful. But “muh LiDaR”. Shut up. You know nothing about sensors, inference, AI, etc.


3) Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.


4) Tesla continues to print money and hoard money. All this talk about “TSLA doesn’t trade on fundamentals only musk failed promises” is equally regarded. They’ve been successful at reinvesting in areas where they either created demand or already have demand. TSLA is a successful fucking company, deal with it, idiots.


5) “But musk is a liar who manipulates the stock”. Shut up. TSLA isn’t a conspiracy. This often referenced “cult” doesn’t have enough money combined to move the stock $1.


6) Robotaxi will turn out to be a success.


7) Optimus is also postured to scale for practical use better than any of its competitors. It will also be a success.


In other words. I’m done listening to you losers."

UBER is 100% going to crush earnings,1729101943.0,406,1g55vs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g55vs8/uber_is_100_going_to_crush_earnings/,205,"The crux of this thesis is well explained in this[ WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/) from earlier in the year. The thesis was correct - Uber missed earnings badly due to investment losses, and the stock tanked afterwards.

However, Q3 of 2024 earnings will be the *opposite*. Their investments killed it, which should result in blow-out EPS.

**Uber has three major holdings:**

* Aurora Innovations (AUR)
* Didi (DIDIY)
* Grab (GRAB)

**Investment gains during Q3**

AUR $2.81 to $5.95, a 111.74% gain

DIDIY $4.02 to $4.74, a 17.91% gain

GRAB $3.53 to $3.80 a 7.65% gain

**Number of Shares**

AUR 326 million shares

DIDIY 575 million shares

GRAB 535 million share

**Total gains for Q3**

AUR - $1,023,640,000

DIDIY - $414,000,000

GRAB - $144,450,000.

Total gain: $1,582,090,000

**Modeling Q3 2024 EPS**

[EPS estimates are .37 for the quarter](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d&ty=ea). With approximately \~2billion shares outstanding, the net income *just from their investments alone will be EPS of  $.79.* Any additional EPS from operations is gravy. I’m guessing earnings will come in around $1 per share - exceeding EPS estimates by 300%.

The same thing happened back in Q4 2023. UBERS investments did well that quarter and the company blew out estimates. Looking back at Q4 2023 earnings as an indicator for this quarter, the stock moved from $67 to $81 within a week of earnings, a 20.9% gain.

I'm seeing some conflicting data around the actual date that earnings will be released - finviz says 11/06 and yahoo finance says 10/31. I'm currently rolling with the 10/31 date.

1)      If the market shits the bed, this play might shit the bed too.

2)      If Uber’s core business shits the bed or guidance is bad, this might not work.

Flow Traders - antifragile company with potential 50% earnings yield,1729106162.0,3,1g57jde,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g57jde/flow_traders_antifragile_company_with_potential/,16,"# Executive Summary

* “**High uncertainty, low risk**” investment and a **hedge against market volatility/turmoil** - company generates abnormal profits when market volatility and trading volumes increase
* At the same time **built to survive even during low volatility environments** - never had an unprofitable year, FCF conversion averages 90%
* **High returns on trading capital** of 50%+ (up to 100%+ during higher volatility times) and prudent capital allocation
* **Almost no debt** now, but slowly starting to use this opportunity to leverage their high returns
* Employees with **“skin in the game”**
* **Priced as if there will never be any market turmoil** in the future

# Priced as if there will never be any market turmoil

The company itself aims to grow NTI at \~20% CAGR, which is a very ambitious target (though they managed to do it historically). I would use a conservative estimate of 5% for the organic growth. I expect that they will make around €1-2 EPS in a low volatility environment (based on their performance in such periods in history), which corresponds to 5%-10% earnings yield with a current price of €20 (compounded as retained earnings, which will be even better with P/B > 1). This gives me a **total return of 10%-15% in a worst case scenario** - low growth and low volatility forever. Some market turmoil and **higher volatility can easily shift these returns into 20%+ zone.**

However, if there is a crash, FLOW can do 50%-100% in one year, as already happened during the COVID. Back then they made €465mln in Net Profit, which is more than 50% of current market cap. Management constantly emphasizes the fact, that they are even more ready now to take advantage of any extreme events.

I see margin of safety in a few things here:

* FLOW’s trading capital (and book value) almost equals their market cap (\~70-80% of it at the moment)
* FLOW is like a hedge against market turmoil/crash for the portfolio
* FLOW has almost no debt

In my opinion, **FLOW is** **priced now as if there will never be any volatility spikes or market turmoil** in the future and the company will have a very small organic growth.

# Why does the opportunity exist?

# I see a few reasons, why this opportunity exists:

* This situation is what Monish Pabrai calls “**High uncertainty, low risk**” - cash flows can vary a lot from year to year, since they depend a lot on volatility, but they are always positive and are structurally growing, so there is low risk. And Mr. Market hates uncertainty and rarely looks beyond the next few quarters. Every time I check their earnings call, there are a few analysts, which are unhappy because they cannot predict and model FLOW’s future earnings.
* This is quite a small Dutch company and is not so liquid, so big sellers can press the price down. You could see the example of this, when the company dropped 25% in a couple of days when they announced their “Trading Capital Expansion plan” (which included the dividend cut) in the 2024 Q2 earnings call.
* Flow is not screen-friendly. It looks like they have a lot of assets, liabilities, cash and debt, while these are just their long and short positions.
