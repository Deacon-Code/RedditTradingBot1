So, I wanted to bet on Tesla mooning as a result of Trump winning due to their new close relationship, and the deregulation that was coming for Tesla in the new administration. I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!

So here's what I did:  
  
Bought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens... Rolled my weekly calls to 29 Nov/ 20 Dec and held till today. Closed 95%.",821

Because I knew that TSLA would undoubtedly be the biggest gainer after Trump's victory

So I bought TSLA calls and kept them until now, I was overwhelmed with excitement during the days of waiting and thankfully I stuck with it and got the gains I have now

I'm considering whether to sell it for my gains or not",355

IN,Why I am all in $MARA before earnings ,1731275364.0,934,1gobx7k,https://i.redd.it/uhpqb0tia50e1.jpeg,321,"Marathon Digital Holdings is a cryptocurrency mining company that primarily focuses on the mining of Bitcoin. I currently own 20,000 shares and some calls. Here’s why I am all in $MARA:

1. It has the most institutional buy in amongst all the BTC Mining companies. BlackRock owns 15.4%, Vanguard owns 12.25%. They both filed an increase in their positions recently at >100% and 57% respectively. 

Amongst all crypto related stocks, BlackRocks % ownership in $MARA of 15% is also its highest ownership.

2. Mara has the biggest HODL of all miners by a large margin. They have >27,000 BTC and the recent pump up to ~$80,000 per BTC will boost their profitability bigly. UPonly.

3. It has the highest hashrate of all BTC Miners which allows it to mine more BTC than all other miners. 

4. They own their own pool so they are technically the most “American Miner”. MADE IN USA is their slogan and seeing that Donald Trump might want to make America the top btc mining hub in the world, they might garner more support from Trump. (Mining CEOs met with trump fairly recently before the election day)

5. Many other miners have pumped up quite a lot but $MARA has stayed pretty stagnant. IMO it’s time for it to catch up with the rest (mean reversion / rotation back to the biggest btc miner).

6. If you believe in technical analysis, the chart is right under resistance and looking to make a move. 

7. It is the most shorted mining stock at 27% float. It seems like the perfect storm with BTC pumping over the weekend, earnings and it being right under resistance that shorts might get squeezed as they rush to buy back post weekend and before earnings come out.

These are just some of the reasons why I am hyper bullish on $MARA and have went practically all in (94% of my portfolio. 6% is on eth). See y’all after earnings on Tuesday 🫡 Wish me luck",1849

ONE,IonQ - The Hyperbolic Run Just Started,1731367085.0,7,1gp6cnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gp6cnt/ionq_the_hyperbolic_run_just_started/,6,"Ladies and Gentlemen, let me explain to you why IONQ, though up 84%YTD, is about to start an explosive bull run.

**What is IonQ?** Backed by Industry Veterans from companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, Dell, Microsoft: IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company, developing a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.  Quantum computers will not take over traditional computers, but rather will exist alongside them.  For certain computational tasks, you currently need 2,500,000,000 GPUs worth of energy to solve what ONE Quantum Computer will be able to do near-term, an unbelievable saving in energy.  Explaining Quantum Computing as a whole would take several paragraphs, I encourage you to watch this beginner video if interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA) 

Quantum computers have just recently become more powerful than the worlds largest supercomputers for certain problems.

**Energy** \- With the rise in AI energy usage, we’re expected to double our energy consumption demands over the next few years.  Everyone seems to think building up a ton of nuclear reactors and power plants will be the solution to this new energy issue, but the CEO of IonQ disagrees.  He believes Quantum Computing can help AI drastically reduce its energy necessity. 

**AQ64, The Catalysts of all Catalysts** \- A task ran with AQ64 will use 18 Kilowatts of power, comparatively to **multiple billions** of kilowatts for an equivalent task on a GPU.   IonQ says reaching AQ64 will be a “ChatGPT” moment for Quantum Computing, equating to the recent AI boom of just a few years ago.  AQ64 is expected to release towards the end of 2025, but they have consistently CRUSHED target dates, beating their 2022 target date in 2022 by 2 months, 2023 by 7 months, and 2024 by 12 months.  AQ64 is coming sooner than we think.

**UAE x Quantum**: XPANSE QUANTUM is an exclusive forum taking place Nov 20-22 in Abu Dhabi, focusing on cultivating strategic relationships with 2,500 key global leaders in the UAE, and the GCC region.  Obviously they have a ton of money, and with the USA and China recently pouring billions into a new “Quantum Race”, it’s in their best interest to get involved.

**Elise Stefanik, UN 2025 and the “year of quantum”** \- Elise Stefanik was recently, as of 8 hours ago, appointed as UN Ambassador by Donald Trump.  Stefanik has close ties with IonQ [https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524) , and is a strong believer in the US beating China in the “Quantum Race”  Currently, the USA has only issued 1.2 Billion$ to be invested in Quantum over the next 5 years, while China has invested 15 Billion$.  So far, IonQ has received just 54.5M$ from the United States Air Force Research Lab… but that’s about to change…

The United Nations has proclaimed 2025 as the International “Year of Quantum Science and Technology”.  Elise Stefanik is the new UN Ambassador, wants to beat China in the “Quantum Race”, and the entire globe is about to accelerate Quantum development… Get it yet?

The last topic I will mention is Blockchain and Encryption being at threat due to Quantum Computing:  I don’t know enough of this, so I’ll quote one line and leave a link: “Quantum computers could potentially break current blockchain encryption, risking billions in cryptocurrency assets, according to a quantum policy expert.” [https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/)

**Why not other quantum companies?** Compared to other companies Algorithmic Qubits (AQ), IonQ has achieved near to ideal fidelity, AKA, their methods actually work, whereas other companies fail.  On top of this, IONQ has recently begun a spree of not only partnering with, but also acquiring multiple companies in a strategic play to make themselves a defining leader in this emerging sector. 

First came the CPU, then the GPU, next up: the QPU.  So far Quantum Computing has found Value in potential Market Sizes of up to $220 Billion USD, expecting to be in the Trillions in a few years.  None of this is financial advice, and do your own research.

TD,"Novo Nordisk rose more than 2.9% during the session, and JPMorgan put it on its “Positive Catalyst List”",1731351084.0,11,1gozub6,https://i.redd.it/a4bpz44ojb0e1.jpeg,3,"Novo Nordisk rose more than 2.9% during the session, as JPMorgan put the company's stock on its “positive catalyst list” and gave it an “overweight” rating. JPMorgan's reasoning was bullish on Novo Nordisk's upcoming December disclosure of study data on its weight-loss drug CagriSema...

JP Morgan's team of analysts, led by Richard Vosser, believe that the data will likely confirm that CagriSema has the “best in disease profile,” meaning that it has the best weight-loss effect of any weight-loss drug. They expect Novo Nordisk 's shares to rise at least another 10 percent if the drug really works that well.
The analysts predict that the market is most interested in the efficacy data from the REDEFINE 1 clinical trial, which will show that CagriSema has an average weight loss effect of up to 25.1%, which is better than the other two diet pills, Novo Nordisk Wegovy (14.9%) andEli LillyZepbound (20.9%). And, CagriSema's side effects (tolerability) would be about the same as Wegovy and Zepbound.
In addition, TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych has a Buy rating. In a report on Monday, he noted that CagriSema is well on its way to market and that the drug's main active ingredient, semaglutide, continues to be improved.",1232

P,The actual DD for puts on PLTR,1731364082.0,4,1gp56b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gp56b4/the_actual_dd_for_puts_on_pltr/,35,"I know that I'm casting stones at your temples by making a real and reasonable case for PLTR not going to the moon, but I'll be goddamned if the 40% of my portfolio that I have in PLTR puts is gonna be disrespected like this.

  
PLTR is a defense contractor specializing in leveraging data modeling and machine learning algorithms in vaguely-disclosed ways to assist the active and counter-intelligence agencies of federated Western nations, but primarily for the US government. You'll note the absolute rockets around every time that there was a news story announcing PLTR going into a contract for the US govt, and just recently when they went into that deal with Anthropic and AWS. Honestly fucking hilarious that Anthropic has a mission statement about not using AI to enable harm to human beings as they do a deal with a defense contractor but I'm here to make money, not make moral judgements. They should probably change that page though. P  
  
People see ""defense contractor"" and proceed to fully regard the stock as much as one can be regarded here in WSB. Full regard, I must emphasize. The reason that defense contractors are so lucrative isn't just because Uncle Sam has deep pockets.   Defense contractors are valuable for:

* Resale value: I can take an M16, a Humvee, or an AK-47 and sell it to some guy in some country that I can't pronounce, and he can go kill his nemesis with it. Is PLTR gonna resell their algorithms to General Butt-Naked? I seriously fucking doubt it.
* As above, emphasizing the black market aspect: The US military pays a premium on some completely ass hardware because they buy way too much of it to compensate for the fact that quite a bit of it is gonna fall off the back of a truck into that Yugoslavian terrorist cell.
* Long-term viability: I can kill you with a pistol made 100 years ago. A 20-year-old fighter jet is still a serious fucking problem for ground units. A 10 year old Humvee is still drivable and maintainable. But even a 2-year-old algorithm or model? The pace of software and model design is prohibitively expensive for the value you receive. You can't sell a 10 year old program, or most of the time even use the motherfucker with modern software.

  
And onto competition. Yes, right now PLTR has quite a lot of headway in the space of providing artificial intelligence leverage and data processing algorithms for intelligence communities, because that's their Brand, which is to say, digital blood money. More power to you, because christ knows that anybody who made enough money very quickly quit giving a fuck about the way they did it. But the assumption that PLTR has a huge moat is just flat fucking wrong. All the algorithms they use to predict behavior, or patterns in communication, or whatever-the-fuck else? ... literally just the same shit that digital ad providers are running.

  
You notice in their Anthropic and AWS deal that AWS is a digital ad provider? PLTR is soon to be challenged by any company who thinks to generalize their ad-driving software for intelligence reasons. If you can predict the size of the cock ring I'm gonna buy, I can only assume you can predict my next act of terror by my google searches. Is PLTR using some data-driving secret sauce that nobody has heard of? I really fucking doubt it.

  
PLTR is a good company that has mad great headway into their space. But they are not a 450% fair market valuation from fundamentals good. When people lose their hype for AI and it becomes just another industry revolution the way computers were, PLTR's revenue is getting its head bounced off the concrete. It's a matter of digital ad companies and improvement of code-assistant agents challenging what little moat PLTR has in the current market.

  
I'm not gonna hold you that my PLTR puts are absolutely fucking menstrual right now, but I'm buying LEAP puts when my broke ass saves enough from the cubicle farm. Let me reiterate: PLTR is a good company, maybe even a great one, but their moat isn't big enough for a 450% fair market valuation, and even if their moat were bigger, they don't have the same inherent profitability that the other defense contractors do. You can't steal a PLTR algorithm off a truck, or trade the quartermaster some smack for a few dozen rounds of data processing.",4298

CEO,Bullish on Riot / Bitcoin miners ,1731281358.0,81,1goe5ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1goe5ux/bullish_on_riot_bitcoin_miners/,67,"Let’s face it, prior to a month or two ago, it’s been pretty terrible for the Bitcoin mining industry. Across the board it almost all affected companies were down. RIOT in particular. 

But here’s Why I’m Excited About This Stock. Some of which applies to Bitcoin mining in general. 

 RIOT is on the move. The stock has surged to $12.64 this week with impressive trading volumes.

Key Points:

1. Massive Mining Infrastructure

RIOT operates some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the world, including the Corsicana site (with 600MW still under construction) and Rockdale (700MW). While other miners like IREN are planning large-scale sites, RIOT's operations are already up and running, and they’re far ahead in terms of scale.

2. Bitcoin Price Surge

Bitcoin is riding high, currently above $80,000 (and some analysts predict it could hit $100,000 by year-end). RIOT holds over 10,000 BTC, which means as bitcoin prices rise, so does RIOT’s asset base.

3. Future Goals

RIOT’s ambition to hit 100 EH/s by 2027 positions them as a leader in mining hash rate, further boosting their long-term potential.

4. AI Potential

What excites me even more is CEO Jason Les mentioning that RIOT is open to AI opportunities. With their massive mining facilities in Texas—close to key urban centers like Austin and Dallas, with access to cheap power and low latency—they’re perfectly positioned to pivot into AI workloads if the right deal comes along. The growing demand for GPUs in AI, paired with RIOT’s vast infrastructure, could make them a key player in this space as well. Jason has already mentioned they have received a lot of interest in this direction.

5. Political & Market Factors

With Trump returning to office, there could be major benefits for U.S.-based miners. Increased support for domestic bitcoin mining and the likelihood of regulatory changes to ease production could propel bitcoin—and in turn, RIOT—to new highs. As bitcoin rises, so does RIOT's profitability.

The Big Picture:
I’m not claiming RIOT is the only player to watch, but they’re certainly one of the biggest and in a strong position. With bitcoin price potentially reaching $100,000 in the near future, we could see RIOT’s stock easily hit $20-$25 by the end of the year, and $50+ if the market conditions continue to favor them.",2321

Should I take the L and move on? My gut says it’s dumb to close during such an aggressive move, but then again it was saying that last week as well, and since then the stock is up big.

Don’t have much experience trading long expiry options, are these at all likely to recoup their value or am I cooked?

Thanks for any advice.",459
IT,"Stocks that are going to go nuclear, no, literally.",1731176362.0,1588,1gngaye,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gngaye/stocks_that_are_going_to_go_nuclear_no_literally/,847,"You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. 

Many disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.

The issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. 

Enter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. 

Who is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.

  
NuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. 

They went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.

  
You may ask the following: ""How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?"", ""How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!"", ""How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?""

  
I have answers. 

  
Even if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.

The government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. 

Even with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.

He has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.

Even with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).

  
It is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.

FINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:



\*\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.

\*\*\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\*\*\*

\*\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\*\*

\*\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\*

\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\*\*

\*\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\*\*

\*\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\*\*\*

AMSC,AMSC: The Power Grid Play That Could 3x,1731182898.0,102,1gnipp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gnipp3/amsc_the_power_grid_play_that_could_3x/,58,"TLDR: AMSC makes superconductor tech for power grids. With AI data centers consuming ungodly amounts of power and our grid being held together by duct tape, they're sitting on a gold mine.

--

alright degens and r words who need to make up their losses after not catching the trump trades.

AMSC makes high-temperature superconductor tech for power grids. Think of it like upgrading from dial-up to fiber optic, but for electricity. Their superconductor cables can carry 5-200x more power than regular copper lines, and they're already proving it works (look up their AmpaCity project in Germany).

Why it matters now: Every time Nvidia announces another AI data center, someone has to figure out how to get enough power to these energy-hungry beasts. The current grid can't handle it. AMSC's tech isn't just a ""nice to have"" - it's becoming a ""must have."" They're also selling to the Navy (because their tech makes ships' power systems smaller and more reliable) and have a booming wind turbine business in India.

The kicker? The market is pricing this like a boring utility equipment company, but they're sitting at the intersection of AI infrastructure, grid modernization, and clean energy. Orders are up 4x in 4 years, they're finally FCF positive, and analyst estimates are hilariously low (they think 15% growth when the wind business alone will add 50%).

Not financial advice, but when you find a company that's essential to a massive trend (AI power needs) and the market hasn't caught on yet... well, those are the setups that make careers.

The Bull Case

Orders up 4x in 4 years (40-60% growth, not some BS projection)
Finally FCF positive: $11M last quarter
$70M cash, virtually no debt
Currently at 5% FCF yield with massive growth ahead
Key Growth Drivers:

AI data centers need reliable power (duh)
Grid modernization is inevitable
Wind business about to pop off ($250M backlog, major contract is based in india and not driven off current US politics)
Naval contracts providing steady revenue
Why Market Is Wrong:

Analysts modeling 15% growth when wind segment ALONE adds 50%
Trading at 65% discount to electrical equipment peers
Found solid support at $20
Clear path to 3x in 18-24 months

It is still the beginning stages of a monopoly an AI so strong that it is the basis for many experimental psychological studies . If you do not give your money to the AI it will make your life miserable.  Any nation that does not feed the beast, will be left behind.

*THE EMPIRE WILL SPEND WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SUSTAIN ITS HEGEMONY*


Current holding mid xxx ( after selling regrettable 1/3 @ high 20s) currently very low teens average - You and I both know every dip will be purchased . But why ? 

America has been at war on average every 15-20 years .  The red white and blue will spend roughly 5-10% of  military spending into AI.   Likely more if China decides to hit the gas pedal . Undoubted they have already begun. 

With the current presidency will will likely entire a cycle of heavy reinvestment.  While most started investing, Palantir  was selling and training models at the highest levels of time sensitive data.   Why is this cycle crucial ? Because a reduction in conflicts allows PLTR to reassess and reinvest while being the only company with an actual framework of useful AI done at the highest levels and purest forms. 

Consider yourself lucky a 5% increase in institutional ownership and just few weeks gives it near 50% institutional  ownership .  The current macro environment of AI, economy and political situation tilt the  odds  in favour of continuous heavy investment and increased suits coming in. 

This is the only product that has retrained itself over many different models over decades that actually sold . 





This time we are in the brinks of a new Industrial Revolution. Now has never been the best period  to invest on any dip do not be afraid to get your feet wet, especially for those who are in this forever - since forever is my forever  holding period - on a company that has consistently maintained it’s promises quarter after quarter . It was never about the stock price when you knew they hit every goal . When without being gap profitable they told you why ( to pay talent ) and when they  would be. Never once did they ever not do what they said they would . 

To sustain an empire, significant investment is required. Alex Karp and Peter Thiel, both staunch capitalists who champion Western values and American exceptionalism, are key figures in this endeavor. Their interviews reflect their commitment to these principles.

The lack of a viable alternative to capitalism is evident; no other system has lifted more people out of poverty. From fascism to extreme socialism, alternative systems have historically failed. For instance, Mao’s socialist policies in China caused the deaths of over 20 million people, Stalin’s communism led to famine and political purges, and fascism has also proved disastrous. Despite its flaws, capitalism and democracy more precisely **republic democratic meritocracy** have shown more promise in advancing human progress than any other system.  You could never In your own mind give me a PROVEN system that has worked better or tested time . 

Go ahead . Stop here and think . What proven system has worked better ( tech advancement , medical , agriculture , space etc ) and tested time ? Take 2 minutes to think or continue reading.  

Although not perfect and has blood on its hands , it is clearly the lack of better proven alternative. 

**What you want is monopoly** - Peter Thiel 


With a rapid advancement of China and what some believe it is the peak of the American Empire - we are reminded of this by experts like Ray Dalio . **The empire will
Spend whatever to stay at the top.**
Now With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and shifting global dynamics, the U.S. will need to invest heavily in AI to maintain its edge. This necessity underscores Peter Thiel’s belief in the importance of maintaining technological supremacy. Palantir, with its unique position in AI, faces no direct competition, Really no competition within government can even come close to bring such projects to life .  Private enterprise has done better in American history  at taking care of the biggest wars and domestic affairs. Why ? Because government doing it themselves has historically failed .

Free enterprise is much more feasible for government to hire . Much more productive and resourceful, making it crucial for the U.S. to stay ahead. If the current leaders do not act decisively, rivals like China could surpass them. This advcement converts into proven “bootcamps”  or experience that develops to its population through enterprise. Papantir was not kidding when they said it would happen faster rather than later.

MSTR,BTC Analysis pt. 2 (pt. 1 is linked),1731149259.0,11,1gn7izc,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/nQ8IAvzewE,33,"
Disclaimer:

I own some of the stocks mentioned and make this post to understand how you guys feel about btc.

My positions:
1700 shares of MARA (~$32000)
80 shares of MSTR (~$21000)

Recap of my last post:

In the last cycle, MSTR pumped 800% and MARA pumped 2500%. I don’t expect the same volatility this year, but stocks in the sector, including the ones mentioned, are gaining momentum. Stocks with large Bitcoin holdings will pump first (as MSTR is currently doing) and stocks like MARA will have the opportunity to pump strongly due to it being shorted heavily.

Current Golden Opportunity:

1. Donny T in office

This shift is going to be a crucial factor in the BTC bullrun. Currently, the chair of SEC Gary Gensler is a menace to crypto, as heavy regulatory moves are handicapping it’s potential. With pro crypto Donny in office, we will see a swift shift to a pro bitcoin environment. The next point highlights the institutional reaction to this…

2. Heavy institutional buying

Heavy institutional buying is taking place. In fact, following the election, the likes of BlackRock are now DOUBLING down on their BTC holdings. BTC is now at an ATH and no one is talking about it. So what does that mean? Giga whales are the ones currently moving BTC. Retail investors show no interest. And that brings me to my next point.

3. Retail has yet to enter

BTC sees its volatility when retail investors flock in by the millions because BTC is pumping. BTC is currently at ATH thanks to institutions and retail is silent. What does this mean? BTC‘s notorious bullrun has barely started (google trends is showing growing retail interest) and the sky’s the limit.

Questions to you guys:

I’ve been scouring this page for pro BTC posts but have been surprised by the low interest. Could you guys give me your take on why this is? Have you just not been aware of these major catalysts? Or is it too volatile for you? I understand if the general public may be „scared“ to get into BTC but you people are degenerates like myself so I’m not completely understanding why no one here is betting on this.

If you are in the space, what’s your exist strategy? Personally, I will be looking at retail greed to gauge when to sell.

The larger the spike, the larger the correction, though I still think it'll be just a correction for the time being as the mood is currently bullish.

I've had very similar problem in the past, during the known meme stock squeezes, the $OSTK and $TRUP surges...and I've always made money, but I never nearly maxed out, i.e. I've always exited too early.

Not to complain and not implying $COIN will end up like $OSTK...but it is clearly blown up on fundamentals 9 out of 10 times when that happens the stock normally goes down over time.

Two other major reasons I don't think $COIN will be a unicorn are 1) it does not have IP to guard its business; crypto in general is designed as a decentralized concept with public know-how of making it work, which means the more the market matures the higher the competition and there's nothing pushing profits down as well as competition. I don't see that changing in $COIN's favor; and 2) Warren Buffer and Charlie Munger, to both of whom I have great respect, had long said crypto would eventually come to a crash. May take 5, 10 or 50 years and may be irrelevant in the current context, but those two have seen and done way more than I'll ever see and do, so for me it's just a common sense to listen to them.

GDP,Are we delusional about the economy?,1731032970.0,899,1gm84at,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gm84at/are_we_delusional_about_the_economy/,629,"I think the markets are frothy, and we have been going through mini-cycles which raise and lower sentiment almost on a weekly basis, drifting further and further away from fundamentals. Earnings releases, tax cuts (elections), lower rates, etc. - there are endless catalysts. The stock market has become a casino. In my opinion, this all started during COVID with the influx of retail investors (and the boom of this sub) and while we've gone through a ""recession"" and down-markets, the excitement around the stock market is at an all-time high, as are valuations. I've mapped out the last 20 years and have taken a *very simple* approach. I know there are a ton more considerations, so please note any large ones I may be missing. Below is a table I put together in excel, and some explanation on each factor mentioned - when you step back, it looks like we're due for a major reset on valuations.

**TLDR (Takeaways from the table):**

**S&P500 Valuation.** Even though I don't like P/E ratios (in favor of EV/EBITDA), I'll use it as most folks here are more familiar with it. P/E ratios have been around \~20x, and we are currently sitting at 30x. Looking back even further, they used to hover around the 10-20x P/E range. Yes, all companies are growing, so the S&P500 should too. But the growth in valuations is outpacing economic growth (see below). Larger and faster-growing companies deserve higher valuations, so this can be *part* of the reason, but current levels seem to be a stretch, especially if you compare it to actual GDP growth.

**GDP Growth.** This is one I've been focused on lately. Nominal GDP in the US has gone up 2.4x over the last 20 years, yet the S&P500 has gone up 5.1x (total stock market went up 3.7x). Nuances: (1) international revenue of American companies is not in GDP, however the % of foreign revenue in the S&P has remained steady over the last 10-20 years. (2) this doesn't factor in private companies, IPO trends, de-listings, etc. Nominal GDP compares well to S&P500 as both are unadjusted for inflation.

**CPI Index.** ""Inflation has come down, yay!"" The *rate* has come down. Many folks expected deflation after 2022, to restore prices, however that never happened. We're at *higher* prices than 2022. Inflation has picked up 34% over the last 10 years, vs. 24% in the preceding 10 years. Maybe this is the new norm, but it's all factoring into the revenues the S&P companies are generating, and thereby, the valuations.

**National Debt.** I'm not an expert at this category, but we're adding on more national debt at a record pace as well. Most PPP loans were forgiven, credit is cheap (again), so if we keep adding here, when does the circus stop?

Edit: I updated real GDP to nominal GDP below to reflect a more accurate comparison, but the punchline still stands - the S&P has far outpaced it, especially comparing the last decade to the decade before.

They’re in **Phase 3** of FAA certification, with the final phase (Phase 4) coming up. Once they cross that, they’re good to start commercial flights. This isn’t just vaporware they’re actually hitting the steps to get this thing approved.

After a strong move the day before, Archer’s up another 14% post-earnings—serious momentum building here. The price action shows solid investor backing for the progress they’re making. With big partnerships, production on the way, and FAA approval within reach, the fundamentals are aligning for a strong long-term play. Plus, with high short interest still in the mix, there’s real potential for a squeeze if this momentum keeps rolling.

**TL;DR**: Real moves from Archer manufacturing lined up, partnerships stacking, and certification on track. Long play potential here if they keep this up.

TSLA,TSLA Potential Bearish Next Week,1731170290.0,0,1gne1e0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gne1e0,144,"Next week look at potential bearish TSLA crash

Tesla’s recent price action suggest a possibility of a pullback, potentially to the $307 level, before moving up to the $335 range. Analysts have noted that Tesla’s RSI is over 80, placing it in an “overbought” category, which often leads to a temporary pullback as investors take profits. Additionally, technical indicators show that the stock may face resistance near $335, suggesting it may first need to “cool off” with a slight dip before any attempt at higher levels.

If Tesla does pull back to around $307, it could serve as a consolidation phase, allowing the stock to gather momentum for a push upward. However, this movement is contingent on overall market conditions and investor sentiment staying supportive. Some sources view this pullback as a healthy correction within Tesla’s ongoing uptrend, while others suggest that breaking below $307 could trigger further declines.

In summary, a pullback to around $307 is likely, but it should be monitored closely, as further decline would indicate potential support level testing around $288. 

While it’s difficult to predict Tesla’s exact movements over the next week, there is some consensus among analysts that the stock could face further volatility.

The price is currently above $320, with analysts having varying opinions about where it could go in the near future. Some predict a potential pullback to the $220–$250 range, particularly considering concerns about profitability and broader market conditions. Other more optimistic forecasts suggest that Tesla could eventually see a rebound, with some price targets as high as $350, but this would be contingent on Tesla maintaining strong market position and positive news, such as advancements in their self-driving tech.

Given these mixed views, while a pullback to around $230–$240 is possible, it is equally plausible that the stock might stabilize around the $300 mark or rise, depending on the broader market trends and company performance.

Market hype is dying down after this past week, people are taking out profits and we are looking at a big potential dip in the stock. Overvaluation and Tesla having a bad year so far if we talk sales and production; the uptrend is most likely over and if you haven’t already this could be a good time to sell. The risk is way too high for minimal profit margins.

They just dropped their Q3 results, and despite all the noise, they’re **CRUSHING IT** on their turnaround plan. They’re exiting their money-losing eCommerce biz, slashing costs, and optimizing cash like legends. 

The juicy part? They raised their full-year Adjusted EBIT guidance to $355M-$360M, and if you slap a modest 15x multiple (where their peers trade) on that, we’re looking at an equity value of around **$3.5 BILLION**. That translates to a target price of **$19.63 per share**. This bad boy’s currently trading at **just $8.05**. Easy double over night. 

This ain't just hopium. They’ve been deleveraging like pros, bringing $117M back home from overseas, and stacking cash like they’re prepping for a hostile takeover. 

The bears are sleeping on this one, but not us. $PBI has **ZERO analyst coverage** right now, meaning we’re getting in early before Wall Street catches on.

TL;DR: $PBI is a classic turnaround play with 2x upside potential — load up before the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

DD,"Bullish DAL – High Travel Demand to Continue Driving the Other AI (Airline Industry) Trade, 100k Options Position ",1731026958.0,40,1gm64sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gm64sx/bullish_dal_high_travel_demand_to_continue/,16,"Previous DD on DAL ([DD1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fa29yp/first_dd_bullish_on_delta_dal_through_both/), [DD2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fka728/delta_airlines_dal_dd_reaffirmation_of_long/)) outlined how margin expansion is driven by premium, rational supply control, and falling oil prices, which will propel the premium brands of the airline business. This materialized as DAL and UAL continued their rally, with DAL up another 30% to 60 since my previous DD, primarily driven by US election results and the Trump Trade.  

With the upcoming holiday season, tourism and air travel are at the top of mind – DAL and UAL are two domestic airlines best positioned on international, premium, and holiday travel. While UAL offers more INTL, DAL leads in premium and reliability, which are essential for vacation trips. 

To get ahead of the holiday season, we aim to gain insight and forecast holiday travel demand and color on air travel going into 2025. With the recent election, recent MAR, ABNB, and EXPE earnings, and shifting macro trends, this post will focus more on forecasting and market dynamics rather than idiosyncrasies within the AI and DAL. We will project air travel demand and other factors affecting air travel and justify a bullish position on DAL going into Investor Day 2024 on 11/20. 

 

Outline 

* US Election Impact on Travel Demand, the Airline Industry (AI) 
* Macro and industry trend implications for DAL 
* MAR, ABNB, EXPE earnings and guidance implications for the AI 
* Analysis of DAL's current positioning, performance, and upcoming catalysts 
* My Positions 

US Election, Trump Trade Impact on Airline Industry (AI) 

Largely under the radar, the AI is part of the larger Trump Trade due to the following factors (https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/fed-meeting-interest-rate-inflation-today-11-07-2024/card/heard-on-the-street-trump-makes-airlines-great-again-but-why--F7MJW5QDNenQ6RoKscio) 

* Green light for M&A (Spirit and JetBlue) to transform the AI landscape 
* Deregulation for AI, 2016 precedent 
* Falling energy and oil prices with increased US production, 2016 precedent 
* Ending wars in Ukraine, the Middle East part of 2024 campaign promise 
* Fiscal policy to boost economy and both consumer and corporate spending, driving air travel demand 
* Tariffs and other fiscal policy to strengthen the dollar, boosting INTL travel (https://www.marcus.com/us/en/resources/heard-at-gs/what-a-strong-us-dollar-means-for-travel) 

 

Macro and Industry Trends Continue to Favor Airlines  - FED, EXPE earnings, ABNB earnings

* Cutting interest rates globally to boost economic activity continuing into the foreseeable future a tailwind for high-leverage industries such as the AI 
* EXPE air revenue up 4% YoY in Q3 compared to 0% in Q2 and 1.7% in Q1, highlighting positive trends 
* EXPE air bookings up 7.8% YoY in Q3, compared to 6.6% in Q2 and 1.4% in Q1 
* EXPE cited strong air bookings as a main driver for Q3 performance 
* EXPE raises FY24 outlook, citing growth and opportunities abroad despite previous travel demand concerns 
* EXPE total B2C revenue down 1.4% YoY in Q3 more than offset by 18.4% B2B revenue increase YoY 
* Mild B2C Q3 revenue decrease does signal travel softness, but combined with air revenue increase strengthens thesis for increasing shift to longer distance, INTL vacation travel 
* ABNB earnings gives insight into travel demand, global 
* ABNB Q3 revenue up 10% YoY 
* Strong performance in core markets (US, Canada, Australia, UK, France) represents 75% of business 
* Sees strong opportunity in expansion into other global markets, bullish sign for INTL travel 
* ABNB performance less informative than EXPE on the AI 

 

Current DAL Performance, Positioning, and Upcoming Catalysts 

DAL and UAL are industry leaders well-positioned for the upcoming holiday travel season. I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:

* DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total 
* Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown) 
* Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue 
* Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends 
* Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends 
* Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers 
* AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop 
* CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20 
* Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends 
* Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively? 
* Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins 
* Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections  

Throughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3). As a tangent: potential upcoming trade opportunity will be comparing actual TSA check-in data during the winter months and trade off the spread between current AI optimism on Q4 travel and modeling what the actual data represents. 

My Positions: 

* 45 Jan25 $55 Calls 
* 100 Jan25 $60 Calls 
* 150 Jan 25 $70 Calls 
* Total position: 100k in Jan25 options

Tesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump’s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.”

ASML,ASML: Why I am giving up on the stock (for the short term),1730966065.0,13,1glletv,https://i.redd.it/e1dm93dtqfzd1.jpeg,34,"ASML is a Netherlands based manufacturer of advanced semiconductor equipment systems. The company enjoys a wide moat as currently this is only company which can manufacture equipments to produce latest 3 NM AI chips.

ASML counts TSM, Samsung, SK Hynix, Intel and others as its customers.

However, demand for non AI semiconductor equipment systems has dropped significantly which prompted ASML to give lower guidance for the next quarter.

The stock was savagely beateb down and fell from 800+€ to 610€ at yesterday's closing.

Why I have given him on hope of revival of ASML fortunes in the short term?

Except for high end AI chips, rest of the chip industry is struggling to increase sales revenue and profits. In absence of increase in sales, the demand for new non-AI chip producing equipments will be very slow.

Only a sliver of the semi conductor industry [that includes NVDA] has order book full for next rwo quarters. But that demand may also taper in by mid 2025 as likes of Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Tesla etc have their data centers and LLMs ready by then.

In absense of new demand for non-AI chips and expected slow down in AI chips, it is unlikely any foundary will place new orders for the ASML equipment [each machine is said to cost between 100 M$-300M$].

Revival in the fortunes of ASML depends on breakthrough in new chip designs which will make it neccessary to spend on new equipments. But that breakthrough may take a year or more [yes, it takes time to discover/invent new technologies & designs with sufficient advantage that merits an upgrade].

ASML stock fell below important psychological resistance of 618 € yesterday, while US tech sector roared to new heights. This weakness is fortunes of ASML is telling and may lead to further drop in price in coming days.

While ASML remains a strong company with a wide moat, but in the current cycle of the semi conductor industry it is unlikely to post strong results.

How to trade?

Buy 580 € PUTs with December 20th expiry.

Happy Trading!

XPO,$QXO: The Brad Jacobs Freight Train You’re All Sleeping On,1730943401.0,10,1glf4c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1glf4c3/qxo_the_brad_jacobs_freight_train_youre_all/,17,"Regards,

Listen up - here’s the deal on QXO. I’m not here to give you some penny stock pitch that’s gonna end with you crying to your bank. I’m talking Brad Jacobs—a name that actually commands respect in business. He took XPO from being small fry to a $15 billion freight monster, and now he’s back for another round. But let’s be real, if you’re looking for some pump-and-dump garbage, this ain’t for you.

The Big Picture: Owning a $1 Trillion Industry
Jacobs doesn’t mess around. He’s here to take over the building products distribution market, which is a trillion-dollar industry begging for a savior to come in and shake it up. When he took on XPO, the logistics industry was a hot mess of inefficiency and disarray. Fast-forward a decade, and XPO is a name every freight guy knows. Now he’s got his sights set on QXO, and this isn’t for some pocket change. This is a takeover.

$5 Billion Cash Stash and No Debt—No Chains Holding QXO Back
Unlike all those broke startups praying for investor mercy, QXO has $5 billion in cold, hard cash with zero debt. That’s right—no loans, no strings, no BS holding them back. They’re not out here begging for quarters; they’re ready to buy, expand, and roll out a carpet of domination.

Why does that matter? Because QXO doesn’t need to play games. They’re stacked with cash, ready to make moves that’ll put smaller players in the rearview. Jacobs isn’t here to gamble; he’s here to grab the industry by the throat, and he’s got the war chest to do it.

The Kushner Factor – Like It or Not
Here’s something juicy for the conspiracy theorists: Jared Kushner is on the board. Yeah, some of you might hate him, but this guy’s got connections up to his eyeballs. And those connections come with cash. His firm, Affinity Partners, dropped a fat $150 million into QXO. Don’t like it? Too bad. Kushner’s network isn’t here to make friends; it’s here to get things done, open doors, and give QXO a reach into corners you don’t even know exist.

When you’re trying to flip a trillion-dollar market on its head, having someone with global influence doesn’t hurt. Kushner might not be your buddy, but trust me, he’s good for business.

Jacobs’ Legacy: The Guy Knows How to Print Money
Listen up, because this isn’t some snake oil show. Jacobs’ track record is rock solid. This guy has pulled off business miracles before, and he doesn’t deal in hype—he deals in results. When he took on XPO, he didn’t just win; he redefined the game. XPO is now a giant, and Jacobs is ready to do the same with QXO.

So, if you’re waiting for him to stumble, keep waiting. Jacobs’ whole career has been about taking scrappy underdogs and turning them into business beasts. Now he’s taking everything he knows and throwing it into QXO. If you can’t see the potential, maybe stick to meme stocks.

The Stock Split Debacle – Here’s What Actually Happened
Ah, the infamous 1-for-8 reverse split. Yeah, that was a bit of a ride, but let me break it down for you: this wasn’t some sneaky “oh no, we’re failing” move. This was QXO setting itself up to be taken seriously by institutional investors. The split pushed the price up, making QXO look less like a penny stock and more like a heavyweight. But some of you lost your minds when it hit $235 on June 10th and the market cap skyrocketed to $90 billion. Did QXO magically become worth as much as Amazon overnight? No, don’t be dumb.

Here’s what went down: because of the share structure change, there were way fewer shares out there for the taking. The supply got tighter than a drum, so naturally, the price shot up, and platforms didn’t adjust fast enough. It was a hiccup. The market cap was basically a mirage, not a problem with the company. If you panicked, that’s on you, not QXO.

Since then, it’s settled down to a more reasonable $15.25 as of today. This isn’t volatility due to bad business. It’s due to mechanics. QXO still has the same cash pile, no debt, and Jacobs at the helm. If you got weak knees over a glitch in the system, you’re not cut out for this play.

QXO’s Under the Radar – and Underpriced
Here’s the deal: the market’s napping on QXO. Despite the players on board, this stock is still low-key. People are too busy betting on whatever’s hyped that day. But if you can look past the nonsense, this is one of the most undervalued plays you’ll find. Don’t believe me? Look at Trump’s election. QXO didn’t budge. No hype, no pump—it’s steady because it’s built for the long haul.

This isn’t a meme stock. It’s not chasing clout. It’s positioning for a colossal win that takes years, not days. If you don’t have the patience, keep walking.

For the Diamond Hands Only
If you’re here for a 3-day flip, leave now. QXO isn’t for the paper-handed. This is a stock for people who see the big picture, who understand that building value takes time. Brad Jacobs has done it before, and he’s doing it again. You want in? Then you’re here for the ride, no whining allowed. In a few years, QXO will be leading in building products, and the weak hands will be nowhere to be found.

So keep chasing those meme plays if that’s your thing, but for the real players—the ones who see Jacobs’ vision—QXO is one of the few long-term buys that could actually make you rich.

Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.  
  
**Ticker:** $IONQ  
**Industry:** Computer Hardware  
**Current Price:** $16.35

A month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.

I won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.

All the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.

# Sources I recommend:

* Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them.
* Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs.
* Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption.
* IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&utm_content=webinar&utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.

# Revenue Growth and Business Progress

After all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.

https://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55

This is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.

Qubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.

Bottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.

https://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0

Just two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.

https://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289

With hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.

# Business Applications

I’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.

This is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.

https://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe

Recently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.

https://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78

https://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1

It seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.

The good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.

# Options Chain

I’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.

https://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973

# Institutional and Government Interest

In a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.

Additionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.

# Competitors

For those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.

IonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their ""[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)"" agenda.

https://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0

# Bear Thesis

The bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.

Bears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.

But this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?

I think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is ""10 years away."" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.

I’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.

It all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.

# Conclusion

That said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",9867
NVDA,"TSM, buy the dip baby",1730919077.0,14,1gl5wim,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gl5wim/tsm_buy_the_dip_baby/,55,"Anyone else getting in on TSM?

Seems oversold, we are close to pre-earnings levels. Great profit margin around 40%, growing revenues, stable debt, and forward p/e around 21. Seems like a steal!

I get the onshoring trade, but lets get real, NVDA has been working with TSM for a very long time and their processes won't be replicated overnight. The standards for these chips are astronomical to get it right and NVDA has accelerated their manufacturing process with synopsys to speed up their progress.

I get the geopolitical risks as well, but isn't big boy T supposed to bring calm and comfort to the world (or so his supporters think).

Papa Elom also using NVDA chips and likely wants to protect the pipeline as TSM gradually creates new fabs in the USA. As long as they are making progress towards this goal, seems like a reasonable investment. Big boy and Elom wont let the pipeline get disrupted overnight, its too valuable and there would be huge repercussions for china I am sure.

Tarrifs likely to be paid by NVDA and hyperscalers but sure they will get a carve out and pay no tarrifs.",1097

Since I left a lot of money on the table after earnings by having paper hands and selling right at open - and not pricing those calls well to boot - I want to avoid repeating the same mistake. Any advice on pricing the below correctly? (I still have paper hands, so might still sell at open... haha, some trading mistakes are not easy to fix.)

Stock price difference × delta is what I typically use, but that obviously doesn't account for the massive volatility spike today. Any advice on how much to add in for that? Long time lurker, first time poster - thank you in advance!!!

ALAB

I found out about ALABs a few weeks ago around 60\~. Fresh AI/chip company. They just had their earnings, BOOM. I feel like they're going to be on par with Palantir/NVIDIA level growth.

ARBB

ARB IOT does AI with IOT I think, which I personally see as a bit part of the future. They're already putting the internet in everything, next thing you know your smart oven will perfectly roast your duck. POPPING OFF RIGHT NOW

Garbage company. $WMT does everything $CVS does for cheaper (seems to be a theme, doesn't it?)

This turd has been flirting with the $52 level since they bombed earnings in May.

Last time CVS was at $52 level was 2013, 2019, and 2020. If this goes below $52, it will be a straight shot to $44 by Friday.

This is a pig and will be below $45 by Friday.
